Gluten-free beef pasties. (This is one where you’ll have to use your own judgment regarding amounts: we just threw it together, but the addition of lamb stock made the filling especially rich. The point of this post? You can be gluten-free and still feed that craving for a pasty.)

### Beef fresh from the village butcher

## Filling (ingredients)

- Fresh string beef from the local butcher
- Gluten-free flour
- Olive oil or animal fat
- Red wine
- Lamb stock (made with bones from yesterday’s lamb chops)
- Peas and parboiled carrots and potatoes (we used small new potatoes)

### We tossed the beef in gluten-free flour

## Filling (method)

- Dice the meet into small- and medium-sized cubes

- Toss the beef in gluten-free flour

- Brown the beef in oil/fat

- Remove the beef from the pan and deglaze with red wine

- Restore beef to the pan

- Add lamb stock, carrots, peas, and potatoes

- Cook until the mixture is nice and thick


## Preparing the pasties:

- Roll out pastry (look at other entries for gluten-free pastry)

- Cut the dough into large ovals (roughly double the size you want your pasty to be)

- Spoon a heap of filling onto one half of each cut-out portion of dough, being careful to leave room at the edges

- Fold the remaining dough over the filling so that you can crimp the sides together to create a filled packet of pastry

- Brush the pastry with milk if desired

- Bake at about 400 degrees Fahrenheit until the pastry is golden

### Nice, meaty filling

Note: gluten-free pastry does not hold together as well as regular pastry, so you will probably want to eat these on a plate with a knife and fork, for they are unlikely to stay together if you try to eat them with your hands.

### The pasties might not look perfect, but they tasted delicious
