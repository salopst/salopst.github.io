Since I'm getting all old and remember days and prices from long ago, when big hair and awesome music was all the rage, and you had to have a licence to keep a dog, Imma constantly searching for roughly equivalent prices over the years.

This then is lifted squarely (and fairly) from [https://inflation.iamkate.com/](https://inflation.iamkate.com/), for which, üôè thanks!

## Historical prices can be converted into equivalent present-day prices by using historical inflation rates.

## Inflation rate history

- Data for 1949 onwards comes from the Office for National Statistics document [https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/inflationandpriceindices/timeseries/czbh/mm23"](https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/inflationandpriceindices/timeseries/czbh/mm23")

- Data for 1751 to 1948 comes from the 2004 paper *Consumer Price Inflation Since 1750* (ISSN: 0013-0400) **Economic Trends No. 604**, pp 38-46) by Jim O‚ÄôDonoghue, Louise Goulding, and Grahame Allen.
