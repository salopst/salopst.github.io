I've been playing with [Hazel](http://www.noodlesoft.com/hazel.php) a bit recently, mostly so I can get a handle on it to support others' usage of a simple file automation/ housekeeping application. I like it, but it is somewhat limited in not allowed nested conditional and other basic logic statements. Anyway, what Hazel does is not much more-- and very frequently less-- that what I've been doing with ad hoc cron scripts. These are not very tidy having built built up over the years. And so I Googled and I found a x-platform, ruby basedÂ Hazel alternative inÂ [maid](http://rubygems.org/gems/maid).

```bash
$ gem install maid
```

Well I get a slew of errors, so:

```
$ which ruby
/usr/local/bin/ruby
$ ruby -v
ruby 1.8.6 (2007-03-13 patchlevel 0) [i686-darwin8.10.1]
```

This version corresponds to Apple's default on early 2008 Macbook Pros which came preinstalled with Leopard (OS X 10.5). I guess this shows that although I am running Mountain Lion now on a mid-2012 MBP I have not had a clean OS install since April '08, and I have never done so myself on my own machine. So, proof that:

  1. I am lazy?

  2. Upgrades work 'plenty fine', and Apple do a pretty good job in this regard?

  3. I'm scared of losing all the custom build of compilers, interpreters, symlinks, scripts in odd locations doing various things, settings galoreâ€¦ etc, etc. that make this machine mine?


Think I'll persist on this path through Mavericks *then* start fresh with OS XIâ€¦ if I am am still using an increasingly annoying Apple OS.

$ rvm -v
rvm 1.9.0 by Wayne E. Seguin (wayneeseguin@gmail.com) [https://rvm.beginrescueend.com]
$ ls -la /Users/yearlus/.rvm/rubies/

### Update rvm:

```bash
$ cd ~/.rvm/
$ \curl -LÂ https://get.rvm.ioÂ | bash -s -- --version latest
$ rvm -v
A RVM version 1.21.13 is installed yet 1.9.0 is loaded.
Â Please do one of the following:
Â  * 'rvm reload'
Â  * open a new shell

$ rvm reload
RVM reloaded!

$ rvm -v
rvm 1.21.13 (latest) by Wayne E. Seguin <wayneeseguin@gmail.com>, Michal Papis <mpapis@gmail.com> [https://rvm.io/]

$ rvm use 1.9.2
Using /Users/yearlus/.rvm/gems/ruby-1.9.2-p290
$ which ruby
/Users/yearlus/.rvm/rubies/ruby-1.9.2-p290/bin/ruby
```

### I could fsck with `.profile`, but will keep flexible for now. Could also use the default flag:

```bash
$ rvm use 1.9.2 --default
$sudo gem install maid
dyld: Library not loaded: /Users/sjy2/.rvm/rubies/ruby-1.9.2-p290/lib/libruby.1.9.1.dylib Referenced from: /Users/yearlus/.rvm/rubies/ruby-1.9.2-p290/bin/ruby
Reason: image not found
```

### Oh, Brother!

```bash
$ rvm list known
$ rvm list
rvm rubies=> ruby-1.9.2-p290 [ x86_64 ]
$ rvm install 1.9.1
Searching for binary rubies, this might take some time.
No binary rubies available for: osx/10.8/x86_64/ruby-1.9.1-p431.
Continuing with compilation. Please read 'rvm help mount' to get more information on binary rubies.
You requested building with '/usr/bin/gcc-4.2' but it is not in your path.

### ðŸ˜  Grrrr!

```bash
$ sudo rvm requirements

Following worked (outputs omitted):

$ sudo chmod -R g+rwx /usr/local
$ sudo chmod -R o-w /usr/local
