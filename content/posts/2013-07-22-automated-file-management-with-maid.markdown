I've been playing with [Hazel](http://www.noodlesoft.com/hazel.php) a bit recently, mostly so I can get a handle on it to support others' usage of a simple file automation/ housekeeping application. I like it, but it is somewhat limited in not allowed nested conditional and other basic logic statements. Anyway, what Hazel does is not much more-- and very frequently less-- that what I've been doing with ad hoc cron scripts. These are not very tidy having built built up over the years. And so I Googled and I found a x-platform, ruby based Hazel alternative in [maid](http://rubygems.org/gems/maid).


[cc_dos]$ gem install maid[/cc_dos]



Well I get a slew of errors, so:


[cc lang="dos"]
$ which ruby
/usr/local/bin/ruby
$ ruby -v
ruby 1.8.6 (2007-03-13 patchlevel 0) [i686-darwin8.10.1]
[/cc]

This version corresponds to Apple's default on early 2008 Macbook Pros which came preinstalled with Leopard (OS X 10.5). I guess this shows that although I am running Mountain Lion now on a mid-2012 MBP I have not had a clean OS install since April '08, and I have never done so myself on my own machine. So, proof that:


	
  1. I am lazy?

	
  2. Upgrades work 'plenty fine', and Apple do a pretty good job in this regard?

	
  3. I'm scared of losing all the custom build of compilers, interpreters, symlinks, scripts in odd locations doing various things, settings galore… etc, etc. that make this machine mine?




Think I'll persist on this path through Mavericks *then* start fresh with OS XI… if I am am still using an increasingly annoying Apple OS.

I could fsck with .profile, but will keep flexible for now. Could also use the default flag:
