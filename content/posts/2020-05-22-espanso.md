## A cross-platform text expander written in Rust

I was searching the webs for a cross platform (well MacOS and Linux anyway) text-expander, and happened quite by serendipitous accident upon [espanso](https://espanso.org/). It is pretty much ideal for my needs. File-based configuration, can be run in either of my preferred OSes.

It detects when you type a specific keyword and replaces it with something else while you’re typing.

``` bash
ζ ❯ espanso path
Config: /Users/yearluk/Library/Preferences/espanso
Packages: /Users/yearluk/Library/Application Support/espanso/packages
Data: /Users/yearluk/Library/Application Support/espanso

ζ ❯ cd /Users/yearluk/Library/Preferences/espanso
ζ ❯ git init
ζ ❯ git add default.yml
ζ ❯ git commit -m "some rudimentary changes"
ζ ❯ git remote add origin https://github.com/salopst/dotfiles
ζ ❯ git push --force origin master
```
My [default.yaml](https://github.com/salopst/dotfiles/blob/master/default.yml) is here. Again it is "early doors" with this at the moment, but I am liking the app very much and will doubtless be throwing some sheckels in the general direction of the developer. Thanks, [Frederico](https://federicoterzi.com/)!
