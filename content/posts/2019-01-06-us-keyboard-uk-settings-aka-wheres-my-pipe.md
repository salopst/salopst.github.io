`SSH`ed into a local Debian 9 server with a USB-attached US ANSI keyboard only to find the settings geared-up for a UK ISO keyboard. Not a biggie except for the location of the "|" ... pretty important as chars go ðŸ˜‹

So...


```bash
sudo install console-common
sudo dpkg-reconfigure keyboard-configuration
```

Follow all the things

```bash 
sudo service keyboard-setup restart
```

ðŸ’°ðŸ’° PROFIT!!
