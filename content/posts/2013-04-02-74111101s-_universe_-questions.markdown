74111101-- yes, my eldest insists on representing himself as the [ASCII](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII) decimal [code point](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_point) values for his name-- and I have been watching the History Channel's [The Universe](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1051155/). Below some of 74's questions (typed verbatim from his notes) that he hopes to have answered after writing to some of the presenters in the series.

  


  



### Questions





	
  * If the Universe keeps on expanding will it eventually rip apart the things that make up [dark energy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_energy)?

	
  * Is there a known limit to the repulsive effects of dark energy in the way that we know gravity does operate above or below certain distances?

	
  * Is dark enery strong enough to rip apart:

	
    * [dark matter](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_matter) itself?, and

	
    * the atoms that make up stars and "regular matter"? How broken up will matter become? Can it go beyond [fundamental particles](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elementary_particle)?




	
  * If there is antimatter, is there antiDARKmatter?

	
  * Once the sun becomes a white dwarf, is it possible to combine all the gas in the [planetary nebula](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planetary_nebula) and the [outer planets](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outer_planets) to form another sun?

	
  * Is it possible to use the [sun's](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun) energy to start [nuclear fusion](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_fusion) and as the sun gets cooler to add more hydrogen to make it hotter and launch it into space?

	
  * If dark energy is driving the expansion of the Universe will it eventually destroy the particles that cause dark matter? Will this then cause a [big crunch](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Crunch) and possibly a new big bang?
