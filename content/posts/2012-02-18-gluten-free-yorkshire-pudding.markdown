As if a Yorkshire pudding can be gluten-free: please send suggestions of a suitable name for a GF version of something akin to a Yorkshire pudding.

**Ingredients**:



	
  * 150 g gluten-free flour[1]

	
  * 50 g buckwheat flour

	
  * 50 g brown rice flour

	
  * 1/2 tsp baking powder

	
  * 1/2 tsp xanthan gum

	
  * 4 eggs

	
  * 450 ml milk[2]

	
  * 1 tbsp animal fat (beef dripping, lard)


[1] I had exactly 150 g left of a large batch of GF flour I'd made with: equal parts rice flour and garbanzo flour, plus a bit of corn starch to equal 150 g; 1 tsp each of xanthan gum and baking powder

[2] The non-GF recipe called for 150 ml milk and this is quite an increase. However, since many GF flours are very fine and have a high surface-to-volume ratio, they absorb more liquid than wheat flours. In order to achieve the proper consistency in the batter before setting, I added quite a bit of extra milk. I would suggest adding the liquid bit by bit-- putting the extra in by additional 50-100 ml measures.

**Method**:



	
  * Whisk together the dry ingredients

	
  * Make a well in the middle of the flour mix, add the eggs, and beat the eggs together first, then with the flour

	
  * Add the milk and mix until evenly blended and the batter is thin

	
  * Let the batter set for about half an hour

	
  * In this time, preheat the oven to 245 C or 475 F. [I started at 230/450 but went up to 260/500 after 15 minutes]

	
  * While the oven is heating up, put the animal fat in a cast iron skillet/frying pan

	
  * When the oven is heated and the fat is sizzling, pour in the batter

	
  * Place in the oven and cook for 20-30 minutes (original flour recipe called for 15-20, mine was in for 30)

    The batter should be quite runny before resting
