I've been sunning[*] [Solus](https://solus-project.com) as guest in a Parallels virtual machine on a macOS Sierra 10.12.4 host for a couple of months now, and I am delighted and impressed, so impressed I ~~bought the company~~[**] wanted to install this on Apple iron. Solus installed beautifully on an 2010 Lenovo X201 and on a new and cheap and plastically Dell Inspiron 14-3452, so it should have no probs installing on a mid-2012, 15.4" Hi-Res MBP. Right? Right? Wrong!

[*] s/sunning/running/ but gonna let that stand because, as typos go, this is pretty funny
[**] Showing my age... [thanks Victor Kiam!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf22bddvLnc)

So, minus the bits where I was as ~~angry~~ frustrated as a guy who met a [stranger in the Alps](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4koLWPq2qDY&feature=youtu.be&t=1m21s), things were not too bad:

**#01** Grab the 2017-04-18 ISO torrent from [https://solus-project.com/download/](https://solus-project.com/download/)

**#02** Burn to a 16GB shiny-new USB thumdrive using [etcher](https://etcher.io/).

**#03** Press opt (alt) key at boot, select the livecd image
and, *Mr. Franklin*, it balked. Black Screen of Death. If you do the googles this usually has something to do with graphics *and stuff*. Which, for me, means:

```bash
‚ùØ system_profiler SPDisplaysDataType | grep -i chipset
      Chipset Model: Intel HD Graphics 4000
      Chipset Model: NVIDIA GeForce GT 650M[/cc]
```

Boot at runlevel 3, wired connection and all that. Run the usual `dmesg | less`, `journalctl | less`, `linux-driver-management status`, `modprobe and the googles. Poke and prod and pull hair, and finally...

**#1** Press opt (alt) key at boot, select the livecd image

**#2** Immediately press 'e' and edit the kernel command line parameters (boot options), replacing "quiet splash" with "nomodeset nouveau.blacklist=1 3". Full KMS now reads:

```bash
initrd root=live:CDLABEL=SolusLiveBudgie ro rd.luks=0 rd.md=0 nomodeset nouveau.blacklist=1 text 3
```

**#3** Login prompt. User is "live", there is no password

**#4** Become root, password is "root"

**#5** Unload nouveau (open source NVIDIA drivers) 

```bash
# modprobe -r nouveau
```
**#6** get more drivers from the Solus repository

```bash
# eopkg it nvidia-glx drivers
```

**#7** load Intel (integrated) graphics

```bash
# modprobe i915
```

**#8** Boot graphically

```bash
# /sbin/init 5
```

**#9** Install and...

**#10** sell as lakefront property
