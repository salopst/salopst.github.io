# Inserting non ASCII chars in Linux: XCompose and AltGr

## XCompose

`/usr/share/X11/locale/compose` contains thee compose table for various locales. Current locale is found with, err, `locale`. Strange that /s.

The tables below contain a handy reference for my most commonly used (default) altGr inserts with exceptions for 'European' diacritics, `altGR+'+e` for e acute '√©' etc. Since these are so commoly used-- and there are so many of them-- they are not worth listing.

Having realised that there were a couple of missing Old English letters (wynn and yogh), and only ash eth and thorn are represented in the defaults, I added to an seperate `!/.XCompose` file. This file is *additive* to the defaults.

So, whilst I was at that, I added a few IPA glyphs as well. And some Greek entries. The current [.Xcompose](https://gist.github.com/salopst/30aa6db8e59bf1347c32bfb875c0640b), also included below.

For example...

```yaml
<Multi_key> <w> <y>     : "∆ø"  # Latin Small Letter Wynn         U+01BF
<Multi_key> <W> <Y>     : "«∑"  # Latin Capital Letter Wynn       U+01F7
<Multi_key> <g> <h>     : "»ù"  # Latin Small Letter Yogh         U+021D
<Multi_key> <G> <H>     : "»ú"  # Latin Capital Letter Yogh       U+021C
```

**NB**

In addition to using, say `altGr+W+Y` for "«∑", one could equally use `Ctrl+Shift+U+01F7`

## Common defaults

- `altGr + key1 + key2 [+key3] = result`

|key1|key2|result|name|
|---|---|---|---|
| l | = | ¬£ | GBP |
| e | = | ‚Ç¨ | Euro |
| r | = | ‚Çπ | Rupee |
| y | = | ¬• | Yen |
| c | \| | ¬¢ | cent |
| . | : | ‚àµ | because |
| : | . | ‚à¥ | therefore |
| o | o | ¬∞ | degree |
| = | _ | ‚â° | identical |
| = | / | ‚â† | not equal |
| < | = | ‚â§ | less or equal to |
| > | = | ‚â• | greater or equal to |
| + | - | ¬± | plus-minus|
| p | ! | ¬∂ | paragraph (pilcrow) |
| s | ! | ¬ß | section |
| t | h | √æ | thorn |
| d | h | √∞ | eth |
| a | e | √¶ | ash |
| o | e | ≈ì | oe-ligature |

And some 3-keyers:

|key1|key2|key3|result|name|
|---|---|---|---|---|
| - | - | . | ‚Äì | n-dash |
| - | - | - | ‚Äî | m-dash |
| p | o | o | üí© | m-dash |
