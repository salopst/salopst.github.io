## Gāyatrī Mantra (Sāvitri Mantra)


### ॐ भूर्भुवः स्वः 
### तत्सवितुर्वरेण्यं 
### भर्गो देवस्य धीमहि 
### धियो यो नः प्रचोदयात् ॥

In IAST:

#### oṃ bhūr bhuvaḥ svaḥ
#### tat savitur vareṇyaṃ
#### bhargo devasya dhīmahi
#### dhiyo yo naḥ pracodayāt
##### ~~ Rigveda 3.62.10


### 1. OM:  
The Supreme name of God. The single word OM (or AUM) is known as the pranava mantra and is perhaps the most significant mantra in hinduism. It is known as the primary (or seed) or pranava mantra (or bija mantra) because it contains the seed for all other mantras within itself. OM is also referred to in some texts as the primordial sound.

### 2. BHOOR:  
Firstly, the word **Bhoor** implies existence. God is self-existent and independent of all. He is eternal and unchanging. Without beginning and without end, God exists as a continuous, permanent, constant entity. Secondly, the word Bhoor can also mean the Earth, on which we are born and sustained. God is the provider of all, and it is through His divine will that we our blessed with all that we require to maintain us through our lives. Finally, Bhoor signifies Prana, or life (literally, breath).

### 3. BHUVAH: 
**Bhuvah** describes the absolute Consciousness of God. God is self-Conscious as well as being Conscious of all else, and thus is able to control and govern the Universe. Also, the word Bhuvah relates to God's relationship with the celestial world. It denotes God's greatness -  greater than the sky and space, He is boundless and unlimited. Finally, Bhuvah is also indicative of God's role as the remover of all pain and sufferings (Apaana).

### 4. SVAH:  
**Svah** indicates the all-pervading nature of God. He is omnipresent and pervades the entire multi-formed Universe. Without Form Himself, He is able to manifest Himself through the medium of the physical world, and is thus present in each and every physical entity. In this way, God is able to interact with the Universe created by Him, and thus sustain and control it, ensuring its smooth and proper running and function.

### 5. TAT:  
Literally, this word means "that", being used in Sanskrut to denote the third person. It is also mentioned in the Bhagavad Gita by Sri Krishna Himself, where He implies the selfless nature of the word. Being used in the third person, the word had implicit in it the idea of selflesness. Tat then is used here in the Gayatri Mantra to indicate that the worshipper is referring to [that] God, and that the praise being offered to God in the prayer is purely directed towards Hom, without thought of gaining and benefit from that praise.

### 6. SA-VI-TUR:  
**Savita**, from which Savitur is derived, is another name of God, this being the reason that the Gayatri Mantra is often known as the Savitri Mantra. The implication of Savita is of God's status as the fountain, the source of all things. It is through His Divine Grace that the Unniverse exists, and so this word sums up the Mahavyahriti, by describing God's ability to create the Universe and sustain it, as well as, at the right time, bring about its dissolution.

### 7. VA-RE-NY-AM:  
**Varenyam** signifies our acceptance of God, and can be translated as "who is worthy". Ever ready to obtain all the material riches of the world, more often than not, they are a dissapointment once they have been acheived. God however is the one who, once realised and acheived, has the ability to truly satisfy. We therefore accept Him as the Highest reality, and it is to Him that we dedicate our efforts.

### 8. BHAR-GO:  
**Bhargo** is taken to mean the Glorious Light that is God's love and power. It indicates His complete purity-- being absolutely pure Himself, God also has the ability to purify those that come into contact with Him. 

### 9. DE-VAS-YA:
The word Deva, from which this word is derived, has been translated by different people in different ways. It is generally thought of as  simply "God". However, it's meaning is more complex than that. Deva, which forms the root of "Devata" and "Devi", means "quality" or "attribute", and can be thought of as another word for "Guna".

### 10. DHI-MA-HI:
