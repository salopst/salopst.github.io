So, I've signed up for "Greek and Latin Mythology" from U. Penn at [coursera.org](http://www.coursera.org). It should be an interesting diversion in these times of my doing relatively little. A little Homer, Aristarchus, Thucydides, Aristophanes, Vergil, Ovid and the like would be welcome relief. Read all-- or almost all-- of these in English translation as a late teenager, and some of the Latin authors in the original. The Greek however… well, I never got very far with that in High School. Not saying I will this time, but there's a niggling thing at the back of my mind saying that any time learning more of the aorist and the optative etc. would not entirely be wasted.

  


I may get around to posting my "lecture" notes, but in the meantime some links.
