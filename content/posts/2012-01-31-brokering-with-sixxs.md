Going to be changing ipv4 addresses a lot over the next little while, so I've decided to try a different v4-6 brokering arrangement. he.net's tunnelbroker has been rock solid and I've been using it on and off since '08, but I think it time to try something else.

The ideal would be a self-monitoring client that identifies local ipv4 changes here (kind like a dynDNS client might), and renegotiate an ipv6 endpoint to tunnel through based on that change. he.net's configureation is a little more static than that, and there is no API that I can see that I can hook into to write that client myself. I sure as hell am not going the 'scrape screens' route for this.

First up is sixxxs. Looks like they have a client (AICCU) that might do the trick. Here goes.

A lot of the below is lifted from [https://www.sixxs.net/wiki/Aiccu/Installation](https://www.sixxs.net/wiki/Aiccu/Installation) No apologies from me for that. Just wanted it in a concise space for future reference.

- Request a tunnel from [https://www.sixxs.net/home/requesttunnel/](https://www.sixxs.net/home/requesttunnel/) (request approved in ca. 15 mins)

- Download tun/tap drivers (tuntap_20111101.tar.gz) for OSX: [http://tuntaposx.sourceforge.net/download.xhtml](http://tuntaposx.sourceforge.net/download.xhtml)

  - install .pkg

- Get AICCU source: [http://www.sixxs.net/tools/aiccu/#downloads](http://www.sixxs.net/tools/aiccu/#downloads)

  - Install (defaults to /usr/sbin/aiccu ; installs a Debian-style init.d ; config: /etc/aiccu.conf )

```bash
$ tar -zxf aiccu_current.tar.gz
$ cd aiccu
$ make clean
$ make
$ sudo make install
$ chmod 600 /etc/aiccu.conf
$ cd /usr/sbin
$ sudo aiccu start
$ ifconfig -a
```
