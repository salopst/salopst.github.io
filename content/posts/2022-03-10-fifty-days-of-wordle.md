# 50 Days of Wordle

It did get a wee bit harderâ€” maybeâ€” after the NYT buy-out. Not by a whole lot, though.

And "No" I didn't run `grep` over `/usr/share/dict/words`. I mean, what would be the fun in that, a daily whimsy that takes all of two minutes?

That ðŸŽ‰ **majestic** ðŸŽ‰ got-it-in-two was Feb 10 and [P|A|U|S|E] after my usual opening gambit of [A|N|T|R|E].
