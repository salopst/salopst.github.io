Following the illustrirous Johnson Government's recent wailing about Latin, I decided to do the Duolingo Latin tree to see how much I could remember from school. Quite a bit as it happened since I managed to complete the tree with only a handful of errors over about two or three days of pretty casual, bored clicking, tapping and swiping.

OK then, what about modern Latin (AKA Italian ðŸ¤£)? Rather than Duolingo, I thought I'd dive straight into try *Harry Potter e la Pietra Filosofale*; so, with [audiobook from youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8WKLnNf4EA&origin=https://stephen.yearl.us) in ear, and a copy of the English edition nearby in case of dire stuckage, I began a [transcription](https://stephen.yearl.us/pietra-filosofale/).

Not sure how far I'll get with this, especially considering that I'm no fan of HP anyway, but hey, it's something to do. Already I can feel myself drifting away from the language aspect of this and toward the markup of the text. This is now just HTML, but I'm getting into old habits thinking about wistfully about the [TEI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8WKLnNf4EA&origin=https://stephen.yearl.us), or at the very least how I can extract bits from the text programmatically so, say, make ANki flashcards or summut.
