They took out 25 stitches today and replaced them with the butterfly stitches to reduce superficial scaring. Nice of them, but skin scars do no really matter much to me.)

## Anyway the big stuff

- Flexor Digitalis Superficialis @ 2, 3 and 4 was completely severed as was the Flexor Carpi Radialis and the Flexor Digitalis Profundus of 3.

- FDP-2 and FDP-4 cut but not severed

- FDS-5 was damaged.

- A portion of FDS-3 was transferred and sutured to FDP-3.

All internal suturing was done with [FiberWire](http://www.arthrex.com/fiberwire) using modified (Tajima) [Kessler grasping knots](http://www.wheelessonline.com/ortho/flexor_tendon_repair_techniques_core_suture_techniques).

No damage to nerves.... that's good news! Damned close call on the radial, however.

Back on July 23 to see the surgeon, and in the meantime I have hand therapy scheduled for this July 11 and the following Monday (July 15).

Fingers and wrist are immobilized in a splint-- and will be for another six weeks, except for scheduled exercises.

Still fucking painful; still feels like molten lead is flowing through my forearm!
