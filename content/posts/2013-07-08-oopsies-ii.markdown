They took out 25 stitches today and replaced them with the butterfly stitches to reduce superficial scaring. Nice of them, but skin scars do no really matter much to me.![](/wp-uploadswpid-Gray4211.png)




 




Anyway the big stuff:






  * Flexor Digitalis Superficialis @ 2, 3 and 4 was completely severed as was the Flexor Carpi Radialis and the Flexor Digitalis Profundus of 3.


  * FDP-2 and FDP-4 cut but not severed


  * FDS-5 was damaged. 


  * A portion of FDS-3 was transferred and sutured to FDP-3.




All internal suturing was done with [FiberWire](http://www.arthrex.com/fiberwire) using modified (Tajima) [Kessler grasping knots](http://www.wheelessonline.com/ortho/flexor_tendon_repair_techniques_core_suture_techniques).




No damage to nerves.... that's good news! Damed close call on the radial, however.




Back on July 23 to see the surgeon, and in the meantime I have hand therapy scheduled for this July 11 and the following Monday (July 15).




Fingers and wrist are immobilized in a splint-- and will be for another six weeks, except for scheduled exercises.




Still fucking painful; still feels like molten lead is flowing through my forearm!
