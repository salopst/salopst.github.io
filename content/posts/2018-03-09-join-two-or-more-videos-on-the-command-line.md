Having just dropped a couple of 4TB Western Digital NAS drives in the _openmediavault_ box, I can now get around to adding more media. My _Moby Dick_ is split over two DVD disks... that's a pain. Let's join them...

The obvious, and lazy, and probably-will-not-work way:

```bash
~/MyRips/Moby Dick (1998)
$ cat "Moby Dick (1998) - CD 1.avi" "Moby Dick (1998) - CD 2.avi" > "Moby Dick (1998).avi"
```

Video will only play the length of the first file because this is where the avi header information is. Have to rebuild header information.

So let's do this with _ffmpeg_ (making temporary list first for flexibility)...  

```bash
~/MyRips/Moby Dick (1998)
$ printf "file '%s'\n" ./*.avi > manifest.txt
$ ffmpeg -f concat -safe 0 -i manifest.txt -c copy "Moby Dick (1998)"
```

#### ðŸŽ²ðŸŽ² DICE!

#### UNTRIED, BUT MAYBE NEATER:
 
```bash
$ find STREAM -type f -name '*' -printf "file '$PWD/%p'\n"
```
