# Neomutt keybindings

One would think that a websearch for "neomutt keybindings" would turn up such a simple listing, but it does not. (Maybe that is *did not* by the time you are reading this). Anyway, here we go.

Yes, it can be called up at any time using `?` in Neomutt (vid. inf.   ðŸ¤¡), but, in many ways, this is just easier. For xample, you are editng your `muttrc`, you've borked it somehow, and you can't get into the program to get to the help screen.

Neomutt is great. Check it out: <https://neomutt.org/>
