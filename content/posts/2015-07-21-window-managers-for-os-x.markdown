Playing with [Karabiner](https://pqrs.org/osx/karabiner/) and searching for others' keybindings has led me somewhat down the rabbit hole of window management on OS X. There seem to be a bunch, some light-weight, some heavy. Some under active development, others that seem to be abandoned.










managing windows can be a PITA, lots of precision dragging and resizing and all to get the windows into the desired position. Several window managers exist for OS X, and a short, short list would include:

# hyperdock: [https://bahoom.com/hyperdock/](https://bahoom.com/hyperdock/)




# spectacle: [http://spectacleapp.com/](http://spectacleapp.com/)




# divvy: [http://mizage.com/divvy/](http://mizage.com/divvy/)




# slate: [https://github.com/jigish/slate](https://github.com/jigish/slate)







 Slate seems to have been top dog for a while, but is no longer in active development. It would seem that it was replaced by mjolnir [https://github.com/sdegutis/mjolnir/](https://github.com/sdegutis/mjolnir/) which is not a window manager _per se_ but an automation enviroment (using Lua).

Two videos showing the first, moom, and the latter, hammerspoon emulating moom-like behaviour:




#### Moom window placement:







#### Hammerspoon window placement:










The keyboard shortcuts in the hammerspoon example are predicated on setting up a "hyper" key, a meta modifier in Karabiner. More on that later.







Of course all these “auxiliary” apps that make life a little easier on OS X seem to want a place on the menu bar… and that leads into apps that tidy up that menu bar:
