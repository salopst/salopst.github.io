It's been a while since we've baked cookies in this house. In honour of 5 de mayo, we decided to try our hand at some masa-based cookies. The result? Gluten free goodies that went down in the GF and non-GF corners of the house, and that were appealing to the sweet tooth and those who prefer things less sweet.

The recipe I used for guidance was [this](http://www.celiac.com/articles/477/1/Masa-Chocolate-Chip-Cookies-Gluten-Free/Page1.html) one.

We tend to reduce the added sugar by about one half, so the resulting recipe was (roughly!):
* 225g (1 c.) unsalted butter
* 115g (1/2 c.) granulated sugar
* 105g (1/2 c.) brown sugar (we used dark brown sugar)
* 2 large eggs
* 1 tsp. vanilla
* 250g (2 c.) masa harina
* 1 tsp. baking soda
* pinch salt (optional)
* One bag (~340g or 2c.) chocolate chips (and/or nuts, other desired additions)


* Have all ingredients at room temperature; the butter should be soft (in our cold kitchen, I put ours in the microwave for 10-15 seconds)
* Preheat oven to 375 degrees F
* Blend together butter and sugar until light and fluffy; then add eggs and vanilla
* Gradually add masa mixture until just blended
* Mix in chocolate chips (and/or other additions)

* Drop small balls of dough onto a greased cookie sheet
* Bake for ~ 10 minutes, until golden brown
