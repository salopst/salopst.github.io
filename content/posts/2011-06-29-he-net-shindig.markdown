So, these are the only few pics I took of the shindig aboard the Hornet last night. Plenty of others of the Hornet and us on it, and I'm sure there will be plenty in teh days to come, but these are the very few taken during the event itself. 2003-03-04 update: 74111101's journal for the trip has been transcribed @Â [http://mary.yearl.us/visiting-the-uss-hornet-junejuly-2011/](http://mary.yearl.us/visiting-the-uss-hornet-junejuly-2011/)

I am pretty sure that is a good thing... it meant I spent more time with people than in behind a lens.
