Gluten-free beef pasties. (This is one where you’ll have to use your own judgment regarding amounts: we just threw it together, but the addition of lamb stock made the filling especially rich. The point of this post? You can be gluten-free and still feed that craving for a pasty.)

Filling (ingredients):



	
  * Fresh string beef from the local butcher

	
  * Gluten-free flour

	
  * Olive oil or animal fat

	
  * Red wine

	
  * Lamb stock (made with bones from yesterday’s lamb chops)

	
  * Peas and parboiled carrots and potatoes (we used small new potatoes)

Filling (method):



	
  * Dice the meet into small- and medium-sized cubes

	
  * Toss the beef in gluten-free flour

	
  * Brown the beef in oil/fat

	
  * Remove the beef from the pan and deglaze with red wine

	
  * Restore beef to the pan

	
  * Add lamb stock, carrots, peas, and potatoes

	
  * Cook until the mixture is nice and thick


Preparing the pasties:



	
  * Roll out pastry (look at other entries for gluten-free pastry)

	
  * Cut the dough into large ovals (roughly double the size you want your pasty to be)

	
  * Spoon a heap of filling onto one half of each cut-out portion of dough, being careful to leave room at the edges

	
  * Fold the remaining dough over the filling so that you can crimp the sides together to create a filled packet of pastry

	
  * Brush the pastry with milk if desired

	
  * Bake at about 400 degrees Fahrenheit until the pastry is golden

Note: gluten-free pastry does not hold together as well as regular pastry, so you will probably want to eat these on a plate with a knife and fork, for they are unlikely to stay together if you try to eat them with your hands.
