      <description>Oh, the sadness. Oh, the heartbreak. Never mind, stiff upper lip and all that, and remembering that I got the thing from the dump (sans disk and RAM) over a 18 months ago, it has not had a bad run.
Aaand just in case I come across a PSU and get her running again, she was:

After some digging around the usual directories&amp;hellip; a lock file. Kill that, and we&amp;rsquo;re back in business.

      <description>Sooo, my TP-Link Archer C8 AC1750 Gigabit router decided to not play nice after a short power outage. Didn&amp;rsquo;t do much anyway except keep a couple of machines in a their own little subnet in which the pi-hole was located.
Replaced it with&amp;hellip; NETGEAR GS108Tv2 8-Port Gigabit managed switch and flatten the network a little. Everything was peachy with that set up, but the pihole was still on 172.16.0.0/24&amp;hellip; reconfigured that with [cc lang=&amp;ldquo;bash&amp;rdquo; inline=&amp;ldquo;true&amp;rdquo;]pihole -r[/cc] and all looked well except for the pi-hole could not ping outside of the LAN.</description>

      <description>Of Apple-Pyes: A poem, by Mr. [Leonard] Welsted.
OF all the delicates which Britons try, To please the palate, or delight the eye; Of all the several kinds of sumptuous fare, There’s none that can with apple-pye compare, For costly flavour, or substantial paste, For outward beauty, or for inward taste.
WHEN first this infant dish in fashion came, Th’ ingredients were but coarse, and rude the frame; As yet, unpolish’d in the modern arts, Our fathers eat brown bread instead of tarts: Pyes were but indigested lumps of dough, ’Till time and just expence improv’d them so.</description>

      <description>Delia Smith&amp;rsquo;s (kinda) &amp;mdash; le pâté grossier It&amp;rsquo;s in foreign because Number One Son with his most excellent French shamed me into realising that I have been resting on my regarde-mon-stylo, pre-O-level French for too long, and that I really should make more of an effort. How hard can it be, really? On the similarities betwixt English and French, did Dumas not say that English was just French badly pronounced?</description>

      <description>Getting pretty annoyed with keeping track of which browser on which machine has which add blockers installed, so it&amp;rsquo;s time for a more holistic approach. Enter, stage left, the Pi-hole. In short it:
With a Rapsberry Pi 3 model b and a 64GB micro SD card, a set-up that is beefier than it needs to be, but who knows what the Pi will be used for in the future&amp;hellip;
#1 Get Raspbian, and format micro SD card&amp;mdash; after much jiggling with the unlock tab on the adapter and delicatelyrepeatedly inserting-half-inserting into 2012 Macbook Pro&amp;rsquo;s gunked-up card reader port&amp;hellip;</description>

      <description>My local radio station has a quiz every once in a while. The questions are hardly &amp;ldquo;University Challenge&amp;rdquo;, but there is one question that always is fiendishly tricksy and slippery: to identify a place in the county from an anagram of it.
Constantly getting all but one question correct, it is, of course time to cheatuse lateral thinking.
#1 get a list of place names. A gazetteer should do.
#2 Build an index (hash).</description>

      <description>Happy GDPR Day!
With the slew of new cookie warnings and privacy notifications and such, it&amp;rsquo;s time to do something with those annoying domains from content farms that so often pepper search engine results.
Step 1: install Tampermonkey extension
Step 2: set to writing a bunch of JS. But wait, surely someone else has already done this&amp;hellip; they have: https://greasyfork.org/en/scripts/1682-google-hit-hider-by-domain-search-filter-block-sites So a big, BIG thank you to Jefferson Scher.

      <description>Like &amp;gt;90% of folk, I&amp;rsquo;ve typically used whatever POS modem/router/switch/WAP combo that my ISP supplied me with. These all-in-ones are pretty convenient, but there is something just not right about bundling so many features into a single unit&amp;hellip; it basically means that whilst is can do all these things it does not do any one thing particularly well.
Wireless range, for example, is particularly bad (even on the 2.4MHz band). Time for a change.</description>

      <description>Having just dropped a couple of 4TB Western Digital NAS drives in the openmediavault box, I can now get around to adding more media. My Moby Dick is split over two DVD disks&amp;hellip; that&amp;rsquo;s a pain. Let&amp;rsquo;s join them&amp;hellip;
The obvious, and lazy, and probably-will-not-work way:
~/MyRips/Moby Dick (1998) $ cat &amp;#34;Moby Dick (1998) - CD 1.avi&amp;#34; &amp;#34;Moby Dick (1998) - CD 2.avi&amp;#34; &amp;gt; &amp;#34;Moby Dick (1998).avi&amp;#34; Video will only play the length of the first file because this is where the avi header information is.</description>

A fair few movies I encoded to result in less than 1080P files in order to preserve disk space. That is not really an issue (for now). So, what movies have what resolution?

      <description>Part 2 of installing Solus Linux on a 2012 Macbook Pro.
Part 1- simply booting the liveCD to even allow installation is here: https://stephen.yearl.us/installing-solus-linux-on-a-macbook-pro-9
Rebooting after install lead to, you guessed it, the Black Screen of Death again. Solus was installed, accepting all defaults (and therefore one humongous / paritiion), to /dev/sdb2, /dev/sda1 is the EFI partition on which rEFInd was installed when running OSXMacOS.

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been sunning* Solus as guest in a Parallels virtual machine on a macOS Sierra 10.12.4 host for a couple of months now, and I am delighted and impressed, so impressed I bought the company** wanted to install this on Apple iron. Solus installed beautifully on an 2010 Lenovo X201 and on a new and cheap and plastically Dell Inspiron 14-3452, so it should have no probs installing on a mid-2012, 15.</description>

      <description>Playing with Solus recently got me to thinking that maybe I could live again in a Linux world, but rather than running Linux in a Virtual Machine (that would currently be Parallels 12 for me), what if I dit it the other way around? That is, run OS X 10.12.4 (macOS Sierra) as a guest and Linux as a host&amp;hellip;
Download MacOS Sierra from AppStore.

run xmodmap ~/.Xmodmap add that to wherever your startup scripts are for persistence The keycode mappings I got from xev, kind of like &amp;ldquo;keyboard viewer&amp;rdquo; in OS X. Its available in the Solus repo:

      <description>Still playing with Solus OS, and liking it more and more. The eopkg repository of software is a little thin in comparison to the likes of Debian-based apt-get and Arch&amp;rsquo;s AUR, but most of the things I want are there. And if they are not there I am thinking maybe I should review my needs&amp;hellip; I am in the process of planning for a life without OS X/MacOS after all, so a prefect time for reflection.</description>
