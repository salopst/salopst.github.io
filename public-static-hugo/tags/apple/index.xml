      <description>In all the years I&amp;rsquo;ve been running OS X (or MacOS as it is now called) I&amp;rsquo;ve never had the need to su,sudo was always good enough. And this is as it should be.
Until now. Obvs, &amp;ldquo;root&amp;rdquo; is disabled in High Sierra. So&amp;hellip;
$ cd /System/Library/CoreServices/Applications/ $ ls Some cool apps here&amp;hellip;

      <description>Part 2 of installing Solus Linux on a 2012 Macbook Pro.
Part 1- simply booting the liveCD to even allow installation is here: https://stephen.yearl.us/installing-solus-linux-on-a-macbook-pro-9
Rebooting after install lead to, you guessed it, the Black Screen of Death again. Solus was installed, accepting all defaults (and therefore one humongous / paritiion), to /dev/sdb2, /dev/sda1 is the EFI partition on which rEFInd was installed when running OSXMacOS.

      <title>Remapping CAPS LOCK with seil/karabiner</title>

      <description>For the longest time I have had caps lock set to “no action” in System Preferences &amp;raquo; Keyboard&amp;raquo; Modifier Keys:

But recently I’ve been playing with Vim (and also finally getting around to learning how to touch type) a little more now that I have some time on my hands, and decided that I needed an escape key that wasn’t such a PITA to get to without risking breaking my left pinkie.</description>

      <title>Apple Macbook Air USB &#34;superdrive&#34; on a non-Air</title>

      <description>So I borrowed a mate&amp;rsquo;s external USB superdrive in order to get some old files off of archived CDs, and the internal optical drive in my April &amp;lsquo;08 MacBook Pro has long since shit the bed. Requirements for the drive suggest that an Air is required (Apple website, original packaging and a call to an Apple store), and sure enough when plugged into the MBP running Lion (10.7.2)&amp;hellip; no dice.</description>
