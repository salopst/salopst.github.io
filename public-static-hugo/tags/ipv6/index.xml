      <description>It can take a wee while after getting &amp;ldquo;sage&amp;rdquo; to hit 1500. Lots of pretty mundane traceroute6-ing, ping-ing and such, but I stuck through it:

Really I should have scripted something to chron submit the result entries when the command result was obviously valid, but by the time I had found a reliable list of valid ipv6 addrs that were alive and correctly reporting it was too late for me to bother&amp;hellip; and besides I sort of enjoyed the daily catharsis of taking five minutes to submit.</description>

      <title>Brokering with SIXXs</title>

      <description>Going to be changing ipv4 addresses a lot over the next little while, so I&amp;rsquo;ve decided to try a different v4-6 brokering arrangement. he.net&amp;rsquo;s tunnelbroker has been rock solid and I&amp;rsquo;ve been using it on and off since &amp;lsquo;08, but I think it time to try something else.
The ideal would be a self-monitoring client that identifies local ipv4 changes here (kind like a dynDNS client might), and renegotiate an ipv6 endpoint to tunnel through based on that change.</description>

I hope the coveted T-shirt arrives before the celebration on board the USS Hornet.
Update
It did not, but it did just in time for my England trip with the Samster&amp;hellip;
