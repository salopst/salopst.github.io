      <title>From BibTeX to biblatex and biber</title>

      <description>I had occasion to look over some old dissertation-related files from twenty-years ago to this month&amp;hellip; The directory was an odd mix of half-baked [latexpage]$\LaTeX$ and $\textsc{Bib}\TeX $, readable but clearly incomplete *.RTF, *.DOC, and, of course *.SAM. *.SAM files were created by Ami Pro word processor from Lotus that I had running under windows 3.1 on my almost state-of-the-art Dell i486DX2-S. The *.SAM files were what were printed for submission, the $\LaTeX$ stuff was just for giggles, but I did maintain my bibliographies in $\textsc{Bib}\TeX $ format.</description>

      <title>Online LaTeX editing tools</title>

      <description>For whatever reason, I&amp;rsquo;ve bumped into a number of in-browser [latex]\LaTeX[/latex] editing tools recently. I guess these are mostly useful for collaborative efforts, and I can see a reason why one would not want to use Subversion or Git. I mean Eldest is just coming of an age where he&amp;rsquo;s seeing computers as tools for his own use rather than just vectors of games/educational materials/movies. Because I am a benevolent father-dictator, he&amp;rsquo;s already familiar with [latex]\LaTeX[/latex] (and actually loves Computer Modern), and has decided to set all his writings in [latex]\LaTeX[/latex] prior to submission.</description>
