      <description>Shortly after going gluten-free, we tried Bob&amp;rsquo;s Red Mill gluten-free pizza crust. Having lived in New Haven for many years, we like pizza. Bob&amp;rsquo;s didn&amp;rsquo;t measure up, so that was it&amp;hellip;until now. This might not be apizza, but as long as we&amp;rsquo;re gluten-free we may have to settle for a bit less.

Having found a hit with buckwheat pancakes, I decided to try a buckwheat pizza crust. The recipe I adopted was basically the one described here, but without the garlic powder.</description>
