So, school for Joe and Sam was out early today and we thought this afternoon an appropriate time to put the model rocket that Joe and Stephen put together over the weekend out for its maiden launch. There was quite some interest amongst Joe&amp;rsquo;s 3rd Grade class as Mary yesterday had helped Joe at his &amp;ldquo;show and tell&amp;rdquo;, where he told his peers about the launches he has been apart of, both at structured events like at Goddard Space Flight Center, MD, and also private launches with his friends and family.</description>

      <description>TiGeRrrr gave me a model SR-71 Blackbird for Christmas and Aye-Dye built it this weekend. Thank you Tiger and AyeDye. I hope we can launch it on Tuesday because that&amp;rsquo;s when we get home from school early. Mimi found out we can launch it at the baseball diamond. My favorite plane is the F-14A Tomcat. Sammy&amp;rsquo;s is the Blackbird because it is faster but it cannot land on an aircraft carrier like the CVA-12 Hornet we went on in Alameda California.</description>
