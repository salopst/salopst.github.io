      <description>I never really did manage to get into the swing of things with Sublime Text everyone&amp;rsquo;s favourite general-purpose editor since, well TextMate fell out of favour ca. 2009-ish, and generally stuck to TextMate. Sure there&amp;rsquo;s VIM (and it is awesome), but really? Life is better with a pretty and functional editor.
And then along came Atom&amp;hellip; as well as a few others: Brackets and Light Table to name the other two newbies, all better described at SitePoint.</description>
