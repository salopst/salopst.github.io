      <description>How did we do it? First of all, I picked up a new kitchen scale. It&amp;rsquo;s digital and switches easily between metric and US standard units. This makes it easy to fool around with different types of gluten-free flour since the only thing that really matters is that there be double the mass of flour to fat.
