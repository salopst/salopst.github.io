      <description>Even though this is our first gluten-free Christmas, we didn&amp;rsquo;t want to miss out on the pudding. So, we made our own. I was apprehensive, but need not have been.

The basic recipe I followed was this one.Â Note that you have to scroll down the page quite a ways to actually reach the recipe.
I also had this one on hand and my final result combined aspects of both and may have included some improvisation re: dried fruits.</description>
