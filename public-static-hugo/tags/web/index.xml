      <description>The not-very-much-used-by-me Posterous is going offline on April 30th 2013, roughly 12 months after its acquisition by Twitter. I had a few on-and-off posts there, and I guess it would sort of be a shame to loose them, so this is an attempted replacement. The Posterous blog is copied here: http://sjy.yearl.us/sjy/posterous/blog.yearl.us/ &amp;hellip; that was a simple [ccI_bash]wget -r -l inf -k -E -p -nc blog.yearl.us [/cc] but I thought I&amp;rsquo;d also try and group these pages into Wordpress itself a lá http://en.</description>

      <description>Fsked the http://mary.yearl.us WP install last night whilst arsing with names. One single bloody typo in &amp;ldquo;site URL&amp;rdquo; and good luck getting back into the admin panel. WP does not even offer a warning that changing this might be a bad thing, or potentially so.
Fortunately having access to the database I could edit the value in-place in the tables&amp;hellip; now all is well again with the world.
&amp;hellip;except for the fact that I felt I had to sign up&amp;ndash;finally&amp;ndash; for a twitter account just so I could get an API key in order to explore some things on Mar&amp;rsquo;s blog.</description>

      <description>Can&amp;rsquo;t recall through the fog of my own stupidy why I felt it necessaey to whois yearl.us. Anyway, suprised to see Enom Inc in the response, and I don&amp;rsquo;t recall them from the initial registration though &amp;ldquo;registry rocket&amp;rdquo;, a link followed from the ever-so-awesome folks at http://freedns.afraid.org. So, being clouded I thought &amp;ldquo;scam&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;buyout&amp;rdquo;. &amp;ldquo;Oh, woes&amp;rdquo;!, and cast around for a registrar to which to transfer.
Cloudy fog of indignation made somewhat more insideous in that I could not log into hregistryrocket.</description>
