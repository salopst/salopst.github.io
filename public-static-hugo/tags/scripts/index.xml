      <description>I keep meaning to get around to do this, but never do. This eveningÂ I took a look at exercism.io and the installation of its CLI program had a homebrew option, so then was a good a moment as any, that and with the imminent relsease of OS 42 (X.10.10)&amp;hellip;
$brew -v[/cc] ==&amp;gt; 0.9.5
$sudo chown -R `whoami` /usr/local $cd /usr/local $git fetch origin $git reset --hard origin/master $brew cleanup $brew upgrade ==&amp;gt; ALL OK!</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been playing with Hazel a bit recently, mostly so I can get a handle on it to support others&#39; usage of a simple file automation/ housekeeping application. I like it, but it is somewhat limited in not allowed nested conditional and other basic logic statements. Anyway, what Hazel does is not much more&amp;ndash; and very frequently less&amp;ndash; that what I&amp;rsquo;ve been doing with ad hoc cron scripts. These are not very tidy having built built up over the years.</description>
