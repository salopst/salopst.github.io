      <description>[TYPES]
Virginias usually represent the highest percentage in a blend. Although there&amp;rsquo;s a wide range of Virginias to choose from, including bright VA&amp;rsquo;s, matured VA&amp;rsquo;s, and stoved VA&amp;rsquo;s, in general the lighter the color the tangier the taste, with the darker VA&amp;rsquo;s lending a deep, rich note to the blend. Unprocessed VA&amp;rsquo;s tend to produce tongue bite, and stoved VA&amp;rsquo;s tend to bite much less.
Burley, like VA, is a good base tobacco.</description>

      <description>[caption id=&amp;ldquo;attachment_210&amp;rdquo; align=&amp;ldquo;aligncenter&amp;rdquo; width=&amp;ldquo;500&amp;rdquo;] Capt. Kidd pipe[/caption]
So, I purchased this pipe from Ebay at a reasonable price. This was the only picture of the pipe, and I was a little dissapointed to find that on the shank (on the other side, obviously) there was a sizeable chunk of filler, about 2mm in width, 1mm in height rouhtly in the shape of the outline of Autralia.
I was tempted to repackage it and list the item as described by the original seller and just hope that I managed to get my money back.</description>

      <description>So. I inherited a few Peterson tobacco pipes from my father who has been gone a couple of years now. He had what one might call a modest collection, and all were smoked regularly. Nothing fancy &amp;lsquo;just for show&amp;rsquo; except one piece. Anyway, I decided that I would do my level best to clean a few of them. I did this just because I was bored&amp;hellip; but the more I read, the more interested I became.</description>
