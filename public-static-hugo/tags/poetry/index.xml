      <description>[caption id=&amp;ldquo;attachment_210&amp;rdquo; align=&amp;ldquo;aligncenter&amp;rdquo; width=&amp;ldquo;500&amp;rdquo;] Capt. Kidd pipe[/caption]
So, I purchased this pipe from Ebay at a reasonable price. This was the only picture of the pipe, and I was a little dissapointed to find that on the shank (on the other side, obviously) there was a sizeable chunk of filler, about 2mm in width, 1mm in height rouhtly in the shape of the outline of Autralia.
I was tempted to repackage it and list the item as described by the original seller and just hope that I managed to get my money back.</description>
