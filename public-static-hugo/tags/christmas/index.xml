      <description>Even though this is our first gluten-free Christmas, we didn&amp;rsquo;t want to miss out on the pudding. So, we made our own. I was apprehensive, but need not have been.

The basic recipe I followed was this one.Â Note that you have to scroll down the page quite a ways to actually reach the recipe.
I also had this one on hand and my final result combined aspects of both and may have included some improvisation re: dried fruits.</description>

      <description>How did we do it? First of all, I picked up a new kitchen scale. It&amp;rsquo;s digital and switches easily between metric and US standard units. This makes it easy to fool around with different types of gluten-free flour since the only thing that really matters is that there be double the mass of flour to fat.
Right. What about those pies?
  Cranberry mince pies. For the filling, I pretty much followed the recipe given here.</description>
