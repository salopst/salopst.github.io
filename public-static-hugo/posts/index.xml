<p>I was searching the webs for a cross platform (well MacOS and Linux anyway) text-expander, and happened quite by serendipitous accident upon <a href="https://espanso.org/">espanso</a>. It is pretty much ideal for my needs. File-based configuration, can be run in either of my preferred OSes.</p>
<p>It detects when you type a specific keyword and replaces it with something else while you’re typing.</p>

Again it is &ldquo;early doors&rdquo; with this at the moment, but I am liking the app very much and will doubtless be throwing some sheckels in the general direction of the developer.

<p>Hugo&rsquo;s markdown flavour is blackfriday: <a href="https://github.com/russross/blackfriday">https://github.com/russross/blackfriday</a></p>
<h1 id="frontmatter-metadata">Frontmatter metadata</h1>
<p>Hugo supports 4 frontmatter formats:
Front Matter Formats</p>
<ul>
<li>TOML
identified by opening and closing +++.</li>
<li>YAML
identified by opening and closing &mdash;.</li>
<li>JSON
a single JSON object surrounded by ‘{’ and ‘}’, followed by a new line.</li>
<li>ORG
a group of Org mode keywords in the format ‘#+KEY: VALUE’. Any line that does not start with #+ ends the front matter section. Keyword values can be either strings (#+KEY: VALUE) or a whitespace separated list of strings (#+KEY[]: VALUE_1 VALUE_2).</li>
</ul>
<p>The results of my WP export shenanigans give me YAML, but the output from my org file is TOML.</p>
<p>Eg. Wordpress:</p>

            <description>Sooo, my TP-Link Archer C8 AC1750 Gigabit router decided to not play nice after a short power outage. Didn&amp;rsquo;t do much anyway except keep a couple of machines in a their own little subnet in which the pi-hole was located.
Replaced it with&amp;hellip; NETGEAR GS108Tv2 8-Port Gigabit managed switch and flatten the network a little. Everything was peachy with that set up, but the pihole was still on 172.16.0.0/24&amp;hellip; reconfigured that with [cc lang=&amp;ldquo;bash&amp;rdquo; inline=&amp;ldquo;true&amp;rdquo;]pihole -r[/cc] and all looked well except for the pi-hole could not ping outside of the LAN.</description>

OF all the delicates which Britons try, To please the palate, or delight the eye; Of all the several kinds of sumptuous fare, There’s none that can with apple-pye compare, For costly flavour, or substantial paste, For outward beauty, or for inward taste.
WHEN first this infant dish in fashion came, Th’ ingredients were but coarse, and rude the frame; As yet, unpolish’d in the modern arts, Our fathers eat brown bread instead of tarts: Pyes were but indigested lumps of dough, ’Till time and just expence improv’d them so.</description>
            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Of Apple-Pyes: A poem, by Mr. [Leonard] Welsted.</p>
<p>OF all the delicates which Britons try,
To please the palate, or delight the eye;
Of all the several kinds of sumptuous fare,
There’s none that can with apple-pye compare,
For costly flavour, or substantial paste,
For outward beauty, or for inward taste.</p>
<p>WHEN first this infant dish in fashion came,
Th’ ingredients were but coarse, and rude the frame;
As yet, unpolish’d in the modern arts,
Our fathers eat brown bread instead of tarts:
Pyes were but indigested lumps of dough,
’Till time and just expence improv’d them so.</p>
<p>KING Coll (as ancient annals tell)
Renown’d for fiddling and for eating well,
Pippins in homely cakes with honey stew’d,
Just as he bak’d (the proverb says) he brew’d.</p>
<p>THEIR greater art succeeding princes shew’d,
And model’d paste into a nearer mode;
Invention now grew lively, palate nice,
And sugar pointed out the way to spice.</p>
<p>BUT here for ages unimprov’d we stood,
And apple-pyes were still but homely food;
When god-like Edgar, of the Saxon line,
Polite of taste, and studious to refine,
In the dessert perfuming quinces cast,
And perfected with cream the rich repast:</p>
<p>Hence we proceed the outward parts to trim,
With crinkumcranks adorn the polish’d rim,
And each fresh pye the pleas’d spectator greets
With Virgin fancies and with new conceits.</p>
<p>DEAR Nelly, learn with care the pastry art,
And mind the easy precepts I impart;
Draw out your dough elaborately thin,
And cease not to fatigue your rolling-pin:
Of eggs and butter, see you mix enough;
For then the paste will swell into a puff,
Which will in cmmbling sound your praise report,
And eat, as housewives speak, exceeding short:
Rang’d in thick order let your quincies lie;
They give a charming relish to the pye:
If you are wise, you’l1 not brown sugar slight, T
he browner (if I form my judgment right)
A tincture of a bright vermil’ will shed
And stain the pippin, like the quince, with red.</p>
<p>WHEN this is done, there will be wanting still
The just resewe of cloves, and candy’d peel;
Nor can I blame you, if a drop you take
Of orange water, for perfuming sake;
But here the nicety of att is such,
There must not be too little, nor too much;
If with discretion you these costs employ,
They quicken appetite, if not they cloy.</p>
<p>NEXT in your mind this maxim firmly root,
Never o’er-charge your pye with costly fruit:
Oft let your boclkin thro’ the lid be sent,
To give the kind imprison’d treasure vent;
Lest the fermenting liquors, mounting high
Within their brittle bounds, disdain to lie;
Insensibly by constant fretting waste,
And over-run the tenement of paste.</p>
<p>TO chuse your baker, think and think again,
You’1l scarce one honest baker find in ten:
Adust and bruis’d, I’ve often seen a pye
In rich disguise and costly ruin lie;
While the rent crust beheld its form o’erthrown,
Th’ exhausted apples griev’d their moisture flown,
And syrup from their sides run trickling down.</p>
<p>O BE not, be not tempted, lovely Nell,
While the hot piping odours strongly swell,
While the delicious fume creates a gust,
To lick th’ o’erflowing juice, or bite the crust:
You’ll rather stay (if my advice may rule)
Until the hot is temper’d by the cool;
Oh! first infuse the luscious store of cream,
And change the purple to a silver stream;
That smooth balsamick viand first produce,
To give a softness to the tarter juice.</p>
<p>~~ from The Country Housewife’s Family Companion, 1750</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s in foreign because Number One Son with his most excellent French shamed me into realising that I have been resting on my <em>regarde-mon-stylo</em>, pre-O-level French for too long, and that I really should make more of an effort.

<p>Mettez en une terrine ou une moule de pain, <del><del>faites des mots grossiers avec</del></del> décorer des baies de genièvre et des feuilles de laurier, au bain-marie au four pendant 90 minutes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Laisser refroidir (ne pas égoutter les jus environnants) puis, lorsque le pâté est froid, placer une double bande de papier d&rsquo;aluminium sur le dessus et mettre quelques poids pour le presser pendant au moins quelques heures.</p>

<p>Purchased this on a whim. Quite decent, really:

<p>What&rsquo;s the difference? With <strong>forwarding</strong>, if a name has not been previously associated with an IP (ie. ached on the pi-hole), the request is sent upstream and the result cahed.</p>
<p>Aaand in <strong>recursive</strong>&hellip; request is sent to ROOT servers for resolving say, &ldquo;.us&rdquo;, and thence to TLD name servers. Domain lookup will go to AUTHORATATIVE servers handling &ldquo;yearl&rdquo; (and subdomains), and all will be relayed and chached locally. So, a few more steps? Why do this? Neither Cloudflare nor Google (or whatever my upstream DNS would have been) will know where I am going. So, err privacy. Why not do this? It will take longer for the first resolution of a name.</p>
<p>Install the recursive DNS resolver:</p>

            <description>Like &amp;gt;90% of folk, I&amp;rsquo;ve typically used whatever POS modem/router/switch/WAP combo that my ISP supplied me with. These all-in-ones are pretty convenient, but there is something just not right about bundling so many features into a single unit&amp;hellip; it basically means that whilst is can do all these things it does not do any one thing particularly well.
Wireless range, for example, is particularly bad (even on the 2.4MHz band). Time for a change.</description>
            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Like &gt;90% of folk, I&rsquo;ve typically used whatever POS modem/router/switch/WAP combo that my ISP supplied me with. These all-in-ones are pretty convenient, but there is something just not right about bundling so many features into a single unit&hellip; it basically means that whilst is can do all these things it does not do any one thing particularly well.</p>
<p>Wireless range, for example, is particularly bad (even on the 2.4MHz band). Time for a change. I&rsquo;ve finally had enough.</p>
<p>#1 get your router&rsquo;s loin credentials to the service. My ISP had these hard-coded and were not supplied to me. It was a royal waste of 40 minutes trying to explain that I was not trying to login to the TG589vac itself, but instead to use that which allows login to the ISPs edge router&hellip; need this to pass on to the replacement router (Ubiquiti&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.ubnt.com/edgemax/edgerouter-x/">Edgerouter X</a>) otherwise&hellip; no Internetz!</p>
<p>#2 logging in to the TG589vac as &ldquo;admin&rdquo; gives one rather limited options, and certainly none for resetting the router. It&rsquo;s not in the consumer documentation, but log in as &ldquo;engineer&rdquo; and use the value next to &ldquo;Access Key&rdquo; on the bottom of the device.</p>
<p>#3 Gateway &raquo; Setup Your Gateway &raquo; change &ldquo;routed type&rdquo; to bridge</p>
<p>#4 if VSDL retain VLAN 101; if ADSL set ATM VP to 0 and ATM VC to 38</p>
<p>#5 Cross fingers and reboot</p>
<p>#6 Congratulations you now have no Internet access; the TG589vac is now just a modem!</p>
<p>#7 need to get into the device again&hellip; that&rsquo;s an ethernet cable into port #4, so obvs do not connect your new router to this port.</p>
<p>For giggles as &ldquo;engineer&rdquo; you get to see that your ISP has probably enabled TR-069 / CWMP. The what now? That&rsquo;s the L7 protocol that kept your device up-to-date with firmware and such&hellip; or is/was a means for them to have get another means to sniff your packets. If you disabled it as soon as you initially got your device, TURN IT BACK ON BEFORE YOU CALL your ISP&rsquo;s tech support (see #1).  Mine got real pissy when I called on an unrelated issue and they could not get in and poke around.</p>

A fair few movies I encoded to result in less than 1080P files in order to preserve disk space. That is not really an issue (for now). So, what movies have what resolution?
(I feel like this should all been in shell script, but hey; whatever works right?!)

            <description>Part 2 of installing Solus Linux on a 2012 Macbook Pro.

            <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been sunning* Solus as guest in a Parallels virtual machine on a macOS Sierra 10.12.4 host for a couple of months now, and I am delighted and impressed, so impressed I bought the company** wanted to install this on Apple iron. Solus installed beautifully on an 2010 Lenovo X201 and on a new and cheap and plastically Dell Inspiron 14-3452, so it should have no probs installing on a mid-2012, 15.</description>

            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Still playing with <a href="https://solus-project.com">Solus OS</a>, and liking it more and more. The <a href="https://wiki.solus-project.com/Package_Management">eopkg</a> repository of software is a little thin in comparison to the likes of Debian-based apt-get and Arch&rsquo;s AUR, but most of the things I want are there. And if they are not there I am thinking maybe I should review my needs&hellip; I am in the process of planning for a life without OS X/MacOS after all, so a prefect time for reflection. This is also part of the reason I am attracted to Solus&hellip; because not everything is there, and because not everything is answered by a quick google search, I have to take some effort to actually find things out again. Some nostalgia there.</p>
<h2 id="cloudage">Cloudage</h2>
<p><a href="https://librevault.com/">Librevault</a> is&hellip; &ldquo;transfers data directly from one device to another. You can use it in your local network, and it will work even without Internet access.&rdquo; So not exactly cloud storage. In fact not even close to that. So why do I think I need it? I don&rsquo;t. But I wont know until I try. Chances are I can get away with continuing with Dropbox, but since I am working on a major change of OS I might as well kinda think about previous tools and workflows and so on. Anyway there is no librevault in the Solus repository. Compiling time!</p>
<p>Not to flog a dead horse, but what follows is what worked for me, soup to nuts. Playing with librevault will have to wait a few days, cause the weather is awesome and I&rsquo;ve a potato patch to dig out of raw sod up the orchard, Besides <a href="http://rclone.org/">rclone</a> and Google drive are working for what I need <em>at the moment</em>&hellip; and all that is, is, primarily, syncing files from the MacOS partition to the Solus partition. Google drive will have to go though when the time is right.</p>

<p>Now, do I go to the trouble of packaging this? Other&rsquo;s who better know what they are doing in this area will prolly get it done soon enough, but why not give it a shot, eh? If I am going to be living with Solus I might as well get to know her a little better.</p>

            <description>tl;dr I feel that after ten years I can no longer countenance the purchase of a new Apple laptop should my existing machine shit the bed.

<p>I feel that after ten years I can no longer countenance the purchase of a new Apple laptop should my existing machine shit the bed. All that nonsense associated with the race to thinness and the resultant lack of expandability of the newer machines, where everything is soldered or glued into place, has me pretty upset. Oh, and the OS itself has been getting more annoying with each release since Snow Leopard. So I am planning for a day without OS X/ MacOS. After a few distro trials (ongoing) I&rsquo;ve come down to:</p>
<p><a href="https://linuxmint.com/rel_serena_cinnamon_whatsnew.php">Linux Mint 18.1</a></p>
<p><a href="https://solus-project.com/">Solus OS</a></p>
<p><a href="https://www.trueos.org/">True OS</a></p>
<p>With the thinking that Solus will be &ldquo;The One&rdquo;.</p>
<h2 id="problem-iphone-5-ios-1021-14d27-will-not-mount-under-solus-os">Problem: iPhone 5, iOS: 10.2.1 (14D27) will not mount under Solus OS.</h2>
<p>iPhones, generally, used to mount fine prior to the iOS 10 release. The developers of <code>libimobiledevice</code> have rectified this, but many down stream distos have not quite caught up. Solution is to build oneself. Or wait. I didn&rsquo;t want to wait&hellip;. in large part because Solus&rsquo;s packaging system eopkg is completely rewritten and not based on AUR or apt-get I wanted to get to poke around it some more.</p>
<p>My hand-compiling of this is probably moot since Solus, being a rolling release, will eventually catch up. It probably will have by the time any reads this.</p>

            <description>Having used the most excellent Hurricane Electric for the longest time I decided to relocate. In so doing I realised that I was moving from a PHP 5.2 to a PHP 7.1 environment. Gulp! Has it been that long. Expecting lots o&#39; issues, but amazingly no. Just the tiniest of tiny issues:

            <description>Not entirely sure how I managed to hose my user directory, but I did, and it followed a boot into safe mode (reboot and SHIFT) in order to update an ancient MacPorts installation; homebrew sort of replaced that for my usage. OK, no biggie. I have back ups right? I do, but those back up in recent months have been based on Apple&amp;rsquo;s Time Machine. I changed to this from Carbon Copy Cloner by means of experiment.</description>

OK, no biggie. I have back ups right? I do, but those back up in recent months have been based on Apple&rsquo;s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_Machine_%28OS_X%29">Time Machine</a>. I changed to this from <a href="https://bombich.com/">Carbon Copy Cloner</a> by means of experiment. CCC has been bullet-proof, and I have always used it for family members, but there was something enticing about the seeming simplicity of Time Machine&hellip; something that is great for restoring files, but not so great, it turns out, for a full system restore. Suffice to say that a combination of backup solutions really is the way to go.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no point in documenting the failures of Time Machine to restore my system &ldquo;as was&rdquo;, better to say that from a hosed user directory (specifically something with ~/Applications and ~/Library), and after several attempts to restore:</p>
<p>Boot into guest user account and copy busted ~ dir to an external spinning platter hd.</p>
<p>Get new drive from Amazon of the UK; not the best price, but next day delivery, and that is pretty important right now. The Old Crucial MX100 500 GB drive may or may not be fsked, but It has gone through A LOT of write cycles over the past two years, and I could do with an additional drive in case of future failures anyway, so not pissing about, got the Samsung Evo 850, 500GB, and a few dongles. Very happy with the purchases, actually.</p>

<p>New, clean OS X 10.11.5 install</p>
<p>Hey&hellip; it&rsquo;s an opportunity to clear out years of crud&hellip; old compilers, settings weird dot files all sorts of &ldquo;system shit&rdquo; that&rsquo;s accumulated over the past 12 freaking years, and more than a couple of Macs, and to throw out apps that haven&rsquo;t been used in Lord knows how long. It&rsquo;s a bit of a PITA, but I think less so, perhaps, than dealing with all the quirks of years of accumulated cruft.</p>
<hr>
<p>With the Sammy external, CMD+R boot into recovery mode, and select install new OS on the Sammy. OS X check the validity of the current system on disk and then goes and downloads El Cap. in this case. About 4 hours. Boot from the external drive. Create new admin user, log into iCloud with AppleID, then install:</p>

            <description>2016-04-25 Monday Another walk through Well Meadow, along the eastern bank of the Severn, late this morning. All pretty standard stuff. Monty&amp;rsquo;s leash walking is getting better. Did come across a male black lab&amp;ndash; off leash, of course&amp;ndash; who came over to invade his space again. Monts did kick off a little, as the other dog refused to be called back to his owner.
More apologies from the other dog owner.</description>

<p>Another walk through Well Meadow, along the eastern bank of the Severn, late this morning. All pretty standard stuff. Monty&rsquo;s leash walking is getting better. Did come across a male black lab&ndash; off leash, of course&ndash; who came over to invade his space again. Monts did kick off a little, as the other dog refused to be called back to his owner.</p>
<p>More apologies from the other dog owner. Wondering if Monts feels more constrained/threatened by being on a leash when the others are not? Tricky thing there is, how can I trust him off leash if he does not show complete awesomeness off it? Maybe try a long trailing thing?</p>
<p>More baseball cricket action in the yard late afternoon as I attached some wire stock fencing to the main gate. It was rather an unintentional game, for I had left the Montster in the house, back door shut. And that sort of reminded me that yesterday, on the way back from cricket, I swore that I had closed an internal door. Apparently the dawg opens lever -handled doors.</p>
<p>And he eats green olives. Smart fellow.

<p>So the fella is still following me around the house, from room to room. Not pushy, and hasn&rsquo;t gotten in the way yet, even in the darkness of night. He has taken himself into the bedroom a couple of times, but this is never really for very long.</p>
<p>Monts behaved somewhat beautifully when meeting a couple of cats&hellip; and he had some free run chasing sticks in a public place. Admittedly there was no one around, and I could see a good distance if anyone were to come into our world, but still. Gotta start the trust somewhere.</p>

<p>No structured walk today, just fetch-the-ball in the garden.</p>
<p>And early-evening the dog that has too many names [0] just went run about again. Irony of all Ironies when I was adding more stock fence to the gateway out front. So I took to driving around the village all slow and shit looking in people’s gardens, and at kids and dog walkers looking for signs of distress.</p>
<p>Next up on Highley Facebook Page will be &ldquo;watch out for paedo in blue car!” ☺</p>
<p>I did spot him up by the old telephone exchange, and he did come back and jump in the car when I opened the door and called. That’s good. But still. GRRRR! Assdog has no road sense at all. I don’t mind him going out by himself. He just needs to let me know where’s he’s going, who he will be with, and what time he will be back. Otherwise he is GROUNDED!</p>
<p>[0] Montgomery, Montesquieu, Monty, Monts, Monticello, Montessori, Montreal, the Montster</p>
<h2 id="2016-04-28-thursday">2016-04-28 Thursday</h2>
<p>So he has the idea that balls and sticks are to be fetched and brought back; balls are dropped for a human to re-throw, sticks are for holding on to, and playing tug. Dropping something on command is not something that he is used to, but I&rsquo;m sure we can use his doing so with a ball to advantage there. No concept of &ldquo;leave it&rdquo; either. I go to pick up a non-ball, and he&rsquo;s on it. Again using the ball knowledge as a base, I think there is something definite there from which to work.</p>
<p>Lots of anal licking&hellip; some anti-worm medicine ordered.</p>
<h2 id="2016-04-29-friday">2016-04-29 Friday</h2>
<p>Met a couple of doggies off leash down by the Donkey Bridge, and all went where there. Encountered the same dogs on another loop, and again no issue. No hackles at all second time around as Montster was sort on involved in trying to understand &ldquo;drop&rdquo; (stick), &ldquo;leave it&rdquo;, and &ldquo;pick up&rdquo;. This with one of the dogs&ndash; some kind of rough haired terrier&ndash; somewhat in his face.</p>
<p>Monts walking again excellently at heel, coming back when called (but not yet tested under stress), and fetching stick on a trailing lead. All good stuff!</p>
<p>Walk through Bridgnorth High Street&hellip;. no probs with other dogs, yelling kids out of school, and people eating pasties and chips and shit. Bit of shopping in TFM, and again sitting nicely. Stopping and sitting at road crossings, all good.</p>
<h2 id="2016-05-3031-saturdaysunday">2016-05-30/31 Saturday/Sunday</h2>
<p>Brook walks, but for the most part just hangin' in the garden cutting grass and getting fence posts in place. Lots of fetch and recall. Being cautious and locking the back door when I am not paying attention to him&ndash; since he can open the door. Git! Grabbed a 1/2Kg of cheddar off the counter on Sunday. Grrr. Cheese banditry will not be tolerated :-)</p>

<h2 id="0-wha">0. Wha?</h2>
<p>With the coming of the new <a href="http://stephen.yearl.us/rescue-doggie-diary/">doggie into the house</a>, perhaps I will again add more content to the <a href="http://stephen.yearl.us">bloggy thing</a> that I have kinda sorta not really been keeping over the last little while.</p>
<p>Probably this has been done by someone else on the Intertubz, but ach, why not. I have some time on my hands, so here are running notes in <a href="https://ia.net/writer">IA Writer</a> that will make its way to a <a href="https://www.wordpress.com">Wordpress</a> post by some means or other. There’s nothing special about IA writer, by the way. Well, there <strong>is</strong>, but not for the purposes of the Wordpress posting. The same code should work with any plain-ish text file coming from any editor.</p>
<p>Why bother? Well, I think that the primary reason a lot of my notes have not made it to the blog is that it is just such a PITA to go out of my way to make a blog posting. If it all just sorta “works” from my usual workflows than that would perhaps be a very different situation. Not that I think I have anything particularly interesting or unique to say</p>

<h2 id="2-markdown-processors">2. Markdown processors</h2>
<p>Four Ruby processors for playing with markdown are briefly alluded to here: <a href="http://www.sitepoint.com/markdown-processing-ruby/">markdown-processing-ruby</a></p>
<p>And I went ahead and played with two of these:</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/vmg/redcarpet">Redcarpet</a></p>
<pre><code>&lt;code lang=&quot;Bash&quot; class=&quot;Bash&quot;&gt;$ gem install redcarpet -n /usr/local/bin
&lt;/code&gt;
</code></pre>
<p><a href="http://kramdown.gettalong.org/">Kramdown</a></p>
<pre><code>&lt;code lang=&quot;Bash&quot; class=&quot;Bash&quot;&gt;$ gem install kramdown -n /usr/local/bin
&lt;/code&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>But neither of these processors support (yet!) the metadata blocks of <a href="https://github.com/fletcher/MultiMarkdown-5">MultiMarkdown</a>. And kramdown does not recognise the back-tick code-fence (<code> </code>), only the tilda code-fence (~~~ ~~~)</p>
<p>So, install <a href="https://github.com/fletcher/MultiMarkdown-4/">Fletcher Penney’s MultiMarkdown</a>, and test:</p>

<p>So the process for this exercise seems clear:</p>
<ol>
<li>“<del>shell out” to markdown and produce an html file</del></li>
<li>process that html with <a href="https://github.com/sparklemotion/nokogiri">nokogiri</a></li>
<li>post to Wordpress</li>
</ol>
<p>No need to shell out, apparently. tillsc has already built a Ruby extension library around MultiMarkdown, <a href="https://github.com/tillsc/multi_markdown">Ruby MultiMarkdown 4</a>, so
I guess the awkward bit would be how best to execute the ruby script that pulls all this together… from a services menu item, maybe? And then how to deal with edits&hellip; something in the metadata at the head of the file? A call to getPost call to XML RPC to see if an existing post &ldquo;matching&rdquo; (on what criterion?) that about to be posted exists? But what to check on? Is the old post deleted? I suppose when one starts thinking about these things then one might just as well produce an actual interface to Wordpress, but why bother when there are so many such things anyway?</p>
<p>Maybe I will look into that&hellip; but I am reasonably happy with the fact that this post came from iA Writer, and without too much trouble either. Next up? A horror-show of a MultiMarkdown file in iA Writer to to see how much gets translated into a decent-ish looking post.</p>

<p>Posting to Wordpress is pretty straightforward. All the heavy lifting is done by the <a href="https://github.com/zachfeldman/rubypress">rubypress gem</a>, which makes this sort of thing doggone simple (see what I did there!). Here a block of code from that thing I wrote a while ago that scraped a Koine Greek “Word of the Day” from Ἡ Καινὴ Διαθήκη. <a href="http://stephen.yearl.us/koine-greek-word-of-the-day-%E1%BC%90%CF%80%CE%AF%CE%B8%CE%B5%CF%83%CE%B9%CF%82-%CE%B5%CF%89%CF%82-%E1%BC%A1/">Last post here</a></p>

Rather too late in the day to head to that, so went to <a href="http://www.hilbrae.co.uk/">Hilbrae Pets Hotel</a>, about 10 mins away. Spent about 30 mins walking &ldquo;Monty&rdquo;:</p>
<p>Inmate # A1850
Incarcerated: 2016-03-07
Microchip ID: 958000001334904
B&amp;W Collie Cross&ndash; with what? Shepard? Lab? Staffie?
Not castrated
Defo not a working dog&ndash; does not have the eyes
Gun shy
Advised that he was last with a farmer, and Monty took to roaming when not supervised
Good with older kids and adults. Good with dogs. Likes to chase cats and birds. Nothing erratic and unpredictable in other words
Walked well on lead. Very interested in field mice, lots of sniffing and marking&hellip; prolly because not neutered.</p>
<p>So, I &ldquo;Reserved&rdquo; Monty&hellip; Animal control person to come by mid-week to check on fencing and such.</p>
<h3 id="2016-04-19-tuesday">2016-04-19 Tuesday</h3>
<p>Walked with the Montster, played in the paddock, fetching stick. Came when called. Likes to play tug, not very good at letting go of a throw toy. Completely ignored donkeys in paddock next door, and farmers ploughing.</p>
<p>Stool very runny. Apparently he eats only once in the AM&hellip;. mixture of wet cans and kibble&hellip; whatever Hilbrae get from donations, really.</p>
<p>Think I may have trodden on his toe at one point&ndash; let out a bit of a yelp.</p>
<p>Seems a little nervous.</p>
<p>Sat with Monty on bench watching other dogs come and go. No bother. Joked with worker that I&rsquo;d take him home today if I could. That actually happened. £85 adpotion fee.</p>
<p>Some confusion about vaccinations&ndash; 2016-01-18 by Shropshire Vets (+44 1743 860 920) on  the farm. Does he do so many that he cannot issue certifications? How is not issuing a certification not illegal? Surely vet was paid, so where is the invoice?</p>
<p>No problems with him jumping in the hatchback, though he did come over to the back seat and was very interested in being in the front. Drove slowly. Very slowly.</p>
<p>Late in the day, and knowing of fence gaps at home, kept him on leash. Short loop Vicarage Lane and up through the village.</p>
<p>Day bed in living room. No couch. Slept next to me in bedroom, on floor on old duvet.</p>
<p>Tug toy purchased from Whitburn street pet shop; and lamb and rice kibble by James Wellbeloved. Available on <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/James-Wellbeloved-Food-Adult-Kibble/dp/B002VJR58I/ref=sr_1_2?s=pet-supplies&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1461436390&amp;sr=1-2&amp;keywords=james+wellbeloved+dog+food">Amazon</a>, isn&rsquo;t everything?</p>
<h3 id="2016-04-20-wednesday">2016-04-20 Wednesday</h3>
<p>Early morning walk to the Costcutter. Met dog walkers on the way all good.
Slightly longer loop down Vicarage Lane and up through the village. More livestock. All good.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.tfmsuperstore.co.uk/">TFM</a> to get some fencing wire. Better in the car. Less tendency to move to the front where all the action is. Took him out to see the wire&hellip; tried to mark territory. Dude who picked up wire and placed it in car was biggish, hi viz. Patted Monts. No bother. Ate some Tyrell&rsquo;s crisps.</p>
<p>Walk by the river in B&rsquo;north after an appointment. BC had a bark at him. No response. Still lots of sniffing and marking. No interest in ducks and geese. Sat at the back of the Fosters Arms&hellip; little boy shouting &ldquo;Look. Doggie.&rdquo; No issues. Feeling good about this pooch.</p>
<p>Stools much firmer.</p>
<p>Found Sammy&rsquo;s old football. Played tug in the house. Football destroyed. Noticed that Mont&rsquo;s lower canines are somewhat worn.</p>
<h3 id="2016-04-21-thursday">2016-04-21 Thursday</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=39vcPT7roFU">Happy birthday, Lizzie.</a></p>
<p>Front gate damaged, bent. Put back into rough shape w/ blow torch and sledgehammer. Monts maybe a little freaked because when I called him next he was gone. See Facebook for more details. Apparently he &ldquo;attacked&rdquo; another dog. Possible. I do not know for sure.</p>
<p>Woman brought him back. Stuck her face in his and he was not bothered. I was on edge though.</p>
<p>Rest of the day spent with him off-lead in the garden. Seemed to have no interest in the &raquo;cough&laquo; 22 m missing section of hedge. Solar Panel Dude came by&hellip; bit of a bark, but came to see us in the shed when SPD gave his presentation. Sniffed, then went outside.</p>
<p>Bark at the postie. Perhaps he is recognising this place as his, wants to protect it? Neither  person seemed threatened.</p>
<p>Had twenty minutes cycles of play and my cutting grass. Seemed a little freaked at the staring of various small engines, but was fine once they were running. No chasing of lawnmower.</p>
<p>Went for a pint in the Bache. Free run outside. Delivered glass to counter, Monts came though. No interest in the people inside.</p>
<h3 id="2016-04-22-friday">2016-04-22 Friday</h3>
<p>I feel like shit for some reason. Very slow day. Morning getting some JSA shit done, Mont&rsquo;s merely had a couple of pee &lsquo;n&rsquo;  poos up the yard.</p>
<p>Afternoon up to Bridgnorth and a walk along the river.</p>
<p>Springer comes bounding across an invades our little game of shake hands. Monty slips and there is a bit of a scuffle. Do not know why&hellip; the surprise? Does he want to protect me? Does he feel that I  cannot protect him? NO punishment. Who knows if that was the right thing to do. Thought it best just to ignore it and remain calm. Did scramble like a mad bastard when it happened.</p>
<p>Springer owners very apologetic. Mont&rsquo;s space was defo violated&hellip;. but still he should not have had that response. Equally, I should be more aware and head these things off before they happen. I AM taller and can see father! My nose is not as awesome though!</p>
<p>Does he not like the dry kibble? Seems not to be eating that much&hellip; bought some Tesco &ldquo;<a href="http://www.tesco.com/groceries/product/details/?id=274776848">Chunks in Jelly</a>&rdquo;</p>
<h3 id="2016-04-23-saturday">2016-04-23 Saturday</h3>
<p>Came out to greet delivery guy at the gate (fencing tools&ndash; yay)&hellip; Monts had a bark, hackles slightly raised. Protecting his property?</p>
<p>About Mid-day went down toward Brook&rsquo;s mouth, practised closer leash walking and &ldquo;here&rdquo; to get him to come back and reset before we set off again. I guess if he associates a slack lead with walking, and tight lead with stopping he will soon get the message. Should be careful with over-praise/treats when he does come back to &ldquo;reset&rdquo;, lest he associate this fuss with tight lead.</p>
<p>And then off to the Brook&hellip; first introduction to water. Does not look like he&rsquo;s a swimmer, but he did venture in, digging rocks out of the bed, and fetching sticks in shallow water.</p>
<p>Met no people or other animals. Drove to get us to the two spots. Seems to be getting better and not rushing out of the car. &ldquo;wait&rdquo; is not perfect, but it is pretty good.</p>
<p>Went out for about 1/2 hour without him. Just left. No fuss. VERY excited when I got back. Ignored him until I was ready&hellip; stuff put away, shoes off, etc. then a simple scratch on the head. My coming and going should not be a big deal deal to him. He&rsquo;s already pretty nervous. Need to build the fellow&rsquo;s confidence! Tomorrow will be interesting since I am out pretty much most of the day playing cricket.</p>
<p>Fir the first time he went and put himself to bed&hellip; thus leaving the room I was occupying. That&rsquo;s a good sign.</p>
<h3 id="2016-04-24-sunday">2016-04-24 Sunday</h3>
<p>Spent about an hour and a half on the Alveley side (mostly) of the Severn Valley Country Park. No drama to be had at all on the meeting with doggies&hellip; all of whom were off leash. Montgomery Montesquieu, AKA The Montster, AKA Monty was, of course, on-lead.</p>
<ul>
<li>first off: black lab getting out of car on Highley side. Monts by out car. No fuss</li>
<li>Rescue BC from <a href="http://www.birchhilldogrescue.org.uk">Birch Hill Dog Rescue</a>, Cleobury, female, 7 years. Very nervous she was, tail tucked between legs. She stood some way off not looking at any of us. Monty&rsquo;s hackles slightly raised.  Had him sitting next to me as I shatted with the guy. No sign of Monts be furhter interested in the bitch. Got noticeable calmer with my chatting.
18 mo. German Shepard bitch, &ldquo;Shadow&rdquo; off-leash by the river. Again distracted Monts with liver, other dog was insistent on coming over. They smelt each other. I felt nervous. Monts hacked raised. No outward signs of aggression, wanting to lunge etc. He just seemed wary, and &ldquo;stand-off-ish&rdquo;.</li>
<li>Three Lurchers/Greyhounds mid-bridge. Plenty of time to see them coming. Did some &ldquo;stop&rdquo;, &ldquo;heel&rdquo;, &ldquo;sit&rdquo;, &ldquo;wait&rdquo; basic obedience stuff to distract Monts at bridge end. They came and crowded him. Hackles slightly raised, but he was receptive to some more &ldquo;sit&rdquo; and &ldquo;here&rdquo;. Again nothing happened but smells all around, but you can see he is nervy. Getting the impression he has been attacked in the past.</li>
</ul>
<p>Some good loose leash work. Still a very heavy sniffer&hellip; that ain&rsquo;t going away. But I figure if I associate his sniffing with &ldquo;go sniff&rdquo;, than I can convince him then it is more OK some times than others. He&rsquo;s slowly getting the message that tight lead either means I do not walk, or I turn abruptly around. Also getting more attention from him when just walking loose-leash.</p>
<p>Stopping and waiting at gates and styles, top and bottom of steps/stairs for me to go first, and then only to move on a &ldquo;let&rsquo;s go&rdquo;. Is pretty damned good.</p>
<p>After cricket&hellip; came back some 7 hours later to an effusive welcome which I ignored untl he was calm, then just patted him. PnP up the yard then smacked an old baseball around with him for a bit. That was a hit! Gonna have to teach the fella not to chase red balls, however! Nothing chewed up or urinated on&hellip; so more signs that is following me around is not a precursor to separation anxiety.</p>

            <description>My mother seems to have had rather a lot of damsons on her tree this year. This heavy cropping combined with heavy rain over the last few days has lead to some immediate load-reduction on the broken limb. Fsck the impecunious nature of the (lack of?) pruning over recent years.

I think some kind of everything-damson is in order. But let&amp;rsquo;s start with a pie. Now, I cannot bake for toffee so this should be fun&amp;hellip;</description>

This heavy cropping combined with heavy rain over the last few days has lead to some immediate load-reduction on the broken limb. Fsck the impecunious nature of the (lack of?) pruning over recent years.</p>
<p><a href="http://stephen.yearl.us/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/IMG_0396.jpg"><img src="http://stephen.yearl.us/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/IMG_0396-1024x768.jpg" alt="2015 broken damson limb"></a></p>
<p>I think some kind of everything-damson is in order. But let&rsquo;s start with a pie. Now, I cannot bake for toffee so this should be fun&hellip;</p>
<p>The process is play-as-you go. The measurements below are play as I went, and are accurate.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gluten intolerant (yeah, yeah&hellip; whatever), so I&rsquo;m using <a href="https://www.dovesfarm.co.uk/flour-and-ingredients/gluten-and-wheat-free-s-r-white-flour-x-1kg/">Dove&rsquo;s GF self-raising flour</a>.</p>
<h4 id="pastry-ingredients">Pastry Ingredients:</h4>
<p>100g butter (unsalted)
300g Dove&rsquo;s self-raising
75g light brown sugar
3 large egg yolks</p>
<p>Right. I half remember beating sugar and butter as the basis for pretty much everything that is (non-bread related) baking from home economics class. Yes, I am that old. So beat the sugar and the butter until creamy, then add the egg yolks. Delicious. Then add the sifted flour.</p>
<p>Dice! Dough. What sort, I do not know.</p>
<p><a href="http://stephen.yearl.us/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/damson-custard-pie.jpg"><img src="http://stephen.yearl.us/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/damson-custard-pie-1024x768.jpg" alt="damson-custard-pie"></a></p>
<p>Roll out with used wine bottle, and lay over tin/aluminium/kitchen foil, add another layer of foil on top then some bean-like things and bake for 10 minutes at 220 ºC. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not smooth,&rdquo; you say? &ldquo;Bollox!&rdquo; I say. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m new. It&rsquo;s my first day.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a href="http://stephen.yearl.us/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/damson-custard-pie-1.jpg"><img src="http://stephen.yearl.us/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/damson-custard-pie-1-1024x768.jpg" alt="damson-custard-pie (1)"></a></p>
<h4 id="the-jam-like-bit">The jam-like bit:</h4>
<p>Take damsons from tree. Rinse etc. Add some unkonwn apple specie from apple tree to the damson&rsquo;s tree&rsquo;s southern side&mdash; the sour-ish one where the tree swing is hanging. No idea how much of each&hellip; just mixed and simmered with brown sugar and a little water until it tasted good, and was reduced to jam. I added some xantham gum to thicken because time was running short. Oh, and some fresh vanilla pod scraping tat I&rsquo;d soaked in water, but I realise that this was a pretty sill place to put it. It should have been in the custard topping.</p>
<p><a href="http://stephen.yearl.us/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/damson-custard-pie-2.jpg"><img src="http://stephen.yearl.us/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/damson-custard-pie-2-1024x768.jpg" alt="damson-custard-pie (2)"></a></p>
<p>The spread your jam on your blind-baked pie base. Simples. Meanwhile make custard.</p>
<h4 id="custard">Custard:</h4>
<p>I was out of cream, so I took:</p>
<p>60g of clotted cream, and
300 ml of full-fat milk, and</p>
<p>heated both in the microwave,  gave it a good beating then added to 3 more eggs yolks and 1 egg (and some more vanilla) and took that to the stove to make custard.</p>
<p>The custard, of course, goes over the top of the jam once it is done. It is sprinkled with more sugar, and the whole thing is baked again for 20 mins at whatever temp. I mentioned above.</p>
<h4 id="result">Result:</h4>
<p><a href="http://stephen.yearl.us/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/damson-custard-pie-5.jpg"><img src="http://stephen.yearl.us/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/damson-custard-pie-5-1024x768.jpg" alt="the pie&hellip;"></a></p>
<h4 id="post-scriptum">Post scriptum:</h4>
<p>Sweet base. Sweet jam. Not enough custard to balance the thing.
Too much sugar.</p>
<p>But it is damned tasty. And it is &ldquo;honest&rdquo; and homemade.</p>

            <description>Apparently low-level keybindings in OS X used to be managed through [cc]~/Library/KeyBindings/DefaultKeyBinding.dict[/cc] which did not exist on this 10.10.4 system. So after having created it and added
[cc lang=&amp;ldquo;properties&amp;rdquo;]{ /* Context Menu */ &amp;ldquo;\U0x3fc&amp;rdquo; = &amp;ldquo;rightMouseDown:&amp;quot;; /* Fun-C */ &amp;ldquo;^;&amp;rdquo; = &amp;ldquo;rightMouseDown:&amp;quot;; /* Ctrl-; */

it did, of course, not work.</description>

<p>Googling around a bit, I found <a href="https://pqrs.org/osx/karabiner/">Karabiner (a powerful and stable keyboard customizer for OS X)</a>, and this seems to be able to do the trick perfectly. So, editing [cc inline=&ldquo;true&rdquo;]~/Library/Application Support/Karabiner/private.xml[/cc] to include:
[cc lang=&ldquo;xml&rdquo;]</p>
<pre><code>        VIM HJKL

</code></pre>
<p>[/cc]</p>
<p>I have two very simple sets of keybindings available to me under Karibiner. Fn+H thru L gives me VIM movement <em>in any app</em>, and Fn+c gives me access to contextual menus without the effort of right/control clicking and visual item in OS X.</p>
<p>Karabiner key code data is at <a href="https://github.com/tekezo/Karabiner/blob/master/src/bridge/generator/keycode/data/KeyCode.data">https://github.com/tekezo/Karabiner/blob/master/src/bridge/generator/keycode/data/KeyCode.data</a></p>
<p>OS X keycodes can be gotten from [cc inline=&ldquo;true&rdquo;]events.h,[/cc], thus:</p>
<p>[cc nowrap=&ldquo;false&rdquo; lang=&ldquo;bash&rdquo;]$ grep &lsquo;^ *kVK&rsquo; /System/Library/Frameworks/Carbon.framework/Versions/A/Frameworks/HIToolbox.framework/Versions/A/Headers/Events.h|tr -d ,|while read x y z;do printf &lsquo;%d %s %s\n&rsquo; $z $z ${x#kVK_};done|sort -n
[/cc]</p>
<p>lists them all:</p>

            <description>For the longest time I have had caps lock set to “no action” in System Preferences &amp;raquo; Keyboard&amp;raquo; Modifier Keys:

But recently I’ve been playing with Vim (and also finally getting around to learning how to touch type) a little more now that I have some time on my hands, and decided that I needed an escape key that wasn’t such a PITA to get to without risking breaking my left pinkie.</description>
            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>For the longest time I have had caps lock set to “no action” in System Preferences &raquo; Keyboard&raquo; Modifier Keys:</p>
<p><a href="http://stephen.yearl.us/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/caps-lock-no-action.png"><img src="http://stephen.yearl.us/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/caps-lock-no-action.png" alt="caps-lock-no-action"></a></p>
<p>But recently I’ve been playing with Vim (and also finally getting around to learning how to touch type) a little more now that I have some time on my hands, and decided that I needed an escape key that wasn’t such a PITA to get to without risking breaking my left pinkie. Enter <a href="https://pqrs.org/osx/karabiner/">Karibiner</a></p>
<p>Karabiner bindings are stored in [cci lang=&ldquo;bash&rdquo; inline=&ldquo;true&rdquo;]~/Library/Application Support/Karabiner/private.xml[/cc] the syntax of which is pretty easy to follow, and so I have entry in this file that maps caps lock to escape on the one hand, and also as a “hyper” modifier key when pressed in conjunction with certain other keys. The “code” for this is&quot;</p>
<p>[cc lang=&ldquo;xml&rdquo; nowrap=&ldquo;false&rdquo;]</p>
<pre><code>        F19 to F19
        (F19 to Hyper (ctrl+shift+cmd+opt) + F19 Only, send escape)
        private.f192f19_escape
        
            --KeyOverlaidModifier--
            KeyCode::F19,
            KeyCode::COMMAND_L,
            ModifierFlag::OPTION_L | ModifierFlag::SHIFT_L | ModifierFlag::CONTROL_L,
            KeyCode::ESCAPE
        
    [/cc]
</code></pre>
<p>But, apparently, the caps lock key is a “special&quot; key— at least on Macbook Pro keyboards, and some additional configuration needs be done before entries to Karabiner’s private.xml will take effect. The fundamental new mapping of caps lock is therefore done in <a href="https://pqrs.org/osx/karabiner/seil.html.en">seil</a>  (a “utility for the caps lock key and some international keys in PC keyboards.”):</p>
<p><a href="http://stephen.yearl.us/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/seil-mapping-caps-lock.png"><img src="http://stephen.yearl.us/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/seil-mapping-caps-lock.png" alt="seil-mapping-caps-lock"></a></p>
<p>Here it is mapped to OS X character code 80 (the F19 key). A complete list of OS X key codes can be seen by executing:</p>
<p>[cc lang=&ldquo;bash&rdquo; nowrap=&ldquo;false&rdquo;]grep &lsquo;^ *kVK’ /System/Library/Frameworks/Carbon.framework/Versions/A/Frameworks/HIToolbox.framework/Versions/A/Headers/Events.h|tr -d ,|while read x y z;do printf &lsquo;%d %s %s\n&rsquo; $z $z ${x#kVK_};done|sort -n[/cc]</p>

            <description>Playing with Karabiner and searching for others&#39; keybindings has led me somewhat down the rabbit hole of window management on OS X. There seem to be a bunch, some light-weight, some heavy. Some under active development, others that seem to be abandoned.
managing windows can be a PITA, lots of precision dragging and resizing and all to get the windows into the desired position. Several window managers exist for OS X, and a short, short list would include:</description>

It would seem that it was replaced by mjolnir <a href="https://github.com/sdegutis/mjolnir/">https://github.com/sdegutis/mjolnir/</a> which is not a window manager <em>per se</em> but an automation enviroment (using Lua).

<h4 id="moom-window-placement">Moom window placement:</h4>
<h4 id="hammerspoon-window-placement">Hammerspoon window placement:</h4>
<p>The keyboard shortcuts in the hammerspoon example are predicated on setting up a &ldquo;hyper&rdquo; key, a meta modifier in Karabiner. More on that later.</p>
<p>Of course all these “auxiliary” apps that make life a little easier on OS X seem to want a place on the menu bar… and that leads into apps that tidy up that menu bar:</p>

How or why this happened I know not. Easy peasy to fix with npm, right?

            <description>I had occasion to look over some old dissertation-related files from twenty-years ago to this month&amp;hellip; The directory was an odd mix of half-baked [latexpage]$\LaTeX$ and $\textsc{Bib}\TeX $, readable but clearly incomplete *.RTF, *.DOC, and, of course *.SAM. *.SAM files were created by Ami Pro word processor from Lotus that I had running under windows 3.1 on my almost state-of-the-art Dell i486DX2-S. The *.SAM files were what were printed for submission, the $\LaTeX$ stuff was just for giggles, but I did maintain my bibliographies in $\textsc{Bib}\TeX $ format.</description>

The *.SAM files were what were printed for submission, the $\LaTeX$ stuff was just for giggles, but I <em>did</em> maintain my bibliographies in $\textsc{Bib}\TeX $ format.</p>
<p>More on those *.SAM files in another post, when I have time to look at the content of this ancient work; for now some bib. stuff.</p>
<p><em>New</em> essay3.tex file has in the preamble:
[cc lang=&ldquo;latex&rdquo;]
\usepackage[backend=biber,style=apa,citestyle=authoryear]{biblatex}
\addbibresource{essay3.bib} %no .bib extension if backend=bibtex
[/cc]
and the last six lines of essay3.tex read:
[cc lang=&ldquo;ruby&rdquo;]
\nocite{*}
\printbibliography
\begin{center}
Typeset in \href{http://www.latex-project.org/}{\LaTeX}
\end{center}
\end{document}
[/cc]
So, there are no great shakes to get this file to start using <a href="http://biblatex-biber.sourceforge.net/">biber</a> under $\textsc{Bib}\LaTeX $. And biber is the way to go forward&hellip; Unicode support, ease of style editing, and so forth. (The student of things archival will wonder if I am now messing with the <em>record</em> here. Err, sure, but then I was doing that as soon as the files were moved from those 3.5&quot; floppies. And, anyway, is not <em>every</em> representation different?)</p>
<p>BUT&hellip; essay3.tex would not compile! Now I expected <em>not</em> to be able to read the olde Ami Pro files after twenty years, but I expected more from these arcane plain text files. I bashed (pun intended) around for a couple of hours, tearing hair, wondering if anyone <em>really</em> understands $*\TeX$ anyway, went for a bike ride, and thought about the last twenty years. What had changed? Blair, obviously. Married to a decent, smart, sometimes funny woman. Two lovely boys. Unicode! Unicode happened. Nope. All files UTF-8.</p>
<p>I start going over the *.bib file (which validates using all the usual tools) entry by entry until:</p>
<p>[cc lang=&ldquo;latex&rdquo;]
@pamphlet{lstm_1920,
Author = {&mdash;},
Location = {Liverpool},
Title = {Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine: Historic Record, 1898-1920},
Year = {1920}}
[/cc]</p>
<p>Here I have an &ldquo;&ndash;&rdquo;, an m-dash (three hyphens), and I suddenly recall that biber is written in Perl. In PCREs the hyphen &ldquo;-&rdquo; is a non-letter character, and in the bowels of biber somewhere there is prolly a regexp checking the contents of the &ldquo;author&rdquo; field. Quickfix?
[cc lang=&ldquo;latex&rdquo;]
Author = {\textemdash},
[/cc]</p>
<p>Dice! So there you go&hellip;. looking stupid so you don&rsquo;t have to!</p>

            <description>So, with Apple&amp;rsquo;s release of OS X 10.10.3 on Monday came the new Photo&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;app&amp;rdquo;. In their misguided wisdom our cousins in Cupertino have continued along the path of dumbing-down Mac programs that are inching ever closer to their iOS equivalents.
Their consumer editing program was iPhoto, the &amp;ldquo;pro&amp;rdquo; version, Aperture. Both are to be replaced with the very iOS/iCloud looking Photos, and whilst iPhoto and Aperture could happily share the same photo library, Photos will not.</description>
            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>So, with Apple&rsquo;s release of OS X 10.10.3 on Monday came the new Photo&rsquo;s &ldquo;app&rdquo;. In their misguided wisdom our cousins in Cupertino have continued along the path of dumbing-down Mac programs that are inching ever closer to their iOS equivalents.</p>
<p>Their consumer editing program was iPhoto, the &ldquo;pro&rdquo; version, Aperture. Both are to be replaced with the very iOS/iCloud looking Photos, and whilst iPhoto and Aperture could happily share the same photo library, Photos will not.</p>
<p>Once Photos is launched for the first time it will offer up a very nice, very slick import facility from you old libraries.
<a href="http://stephen.yearl.us/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Screen-Shot-2015-04-23-at-08.37.28.png"><img src="http://stephen.yearl.us/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Screen-Shot-2015-04-23-at-08.37.28.png" alt="Photos_import"></a></p>
<p>But what do we find when then opening Aperture, for example? This image dialogue of seeming impending doom and woe when you realise&ndash; as you already have, since you would not have launched Aperture so early in your review of Photos&ndash; that Photos is not quite the app you really wanted to manage you lovingly assembled photo library:</p>
<p><a href="http://stephen.yearl.us/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Screen-Shot-2015-04-23-at-07.45.09.png"><img src="http://stephen.yearl.us/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Screen-Shot-2015-04-23-at-07.45.09.png" alt="Screen Shot 2015-04-23 at 07.45.09"></a></p>
<p>Ignore the Aperture Library. It was established the first time I launched Aperture. In actual fact I had Aperture and iPhoto happily using the iPhoto Library which scarily can no longer be found!</p>
<p>And the iPhoto equivalent, for reference:
<a href="http://stephen.yearl.us/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Screen-Shot-2015-04-23-at-08.02.01.png"><img src="http://stephen.yearl.us/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Screen-Shot-2015-04-23-at-08.02.01.png" alt="Screen Shot 2015-04-23 at 08.02.01"></a></p>
<p>Oh woes! I guess I will be restoring from backup!!</p>
<p>Except that I could not restore from backup as the size of my laptop&rsquo;s SSD in relation to the size of the backup drive means that I can only keep one “most recent” backup. So I did some playing around.</p>
<p>After the import of the &ldquo;iPhoto Library.photolibrary&rdquo; Photos makes a new library called &ldquo;Photos Library.photoslibrary”, but these are not really different in many ways. There are “hard” links (you can Google that yourself) between the contents of each library, they are not copies <em>per se</em>. Any changes one makes in iPhoto will to &ldquo;iPhoto Library.photolibrary&rdquo;. Any changes in Photos will be to &ldquo;Photos Library.photoslibrary&rdquo;</p>
<p>The upshot of this is one can still work in Aperture or iPhoto, and make edits. These will not be seen Photos, but if you want to see the changes made in Aperture/iPhoto reflected in Photos, you will have to delete, yes DELETE &ldquo;Photos Library.photoslibrary&rdquo;.</p>
<p>On next launch of Photos, it will think this is a new installation and ask again if you want to import.</p>
<p>It should go without saying that any changes you have made in Photos will be lost, so at some point you are going to have to make a choice. That choice may be an non-Apple product&hellip;. and <a href="https://lightroom.adobe.com/"></a>. I would not be in the least bit surprised if at some point Adobe realises that it is really on to a winner here. Especially if it manages to sync its own library, your iPhoto/Aperture library, or libraries, Photo&rsquo;s library, say certain web stores (Facebook, Instagram, Flikr, whatever), AND random directories on disk. Now how utterly awesome would that be?</p>
<p><strong>I do not know if this process will work in reverse. I doubt it as iPhoto and Aperture are considered obsolete by Apple.</strong></p>

            <description>I never really did manage to get into the swing of things with Sublime Text everyone&amp;rsquo;s favourite general-purpose editor since, well TextMate fell out of favour ca. 2009-ish, and generally stuck to TextMate. Sure there&amp;rsquo;s VIM (and it is awesome), but really? Life is better with a pretty and functional editor.
And then along came Atom&amp;hellip; as well as a few others: Brackets and Light Table to name the other two newbies, all better described at SitePoint.</description>

Sure there&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.vim.org/">VIM</a> (and it is awesome), but really? Life <em>is</em> better with a pretty and functional editor.</p>

Suffice to say that Atom won for me. Despite it being very Sublime-like, I felt comfortable with it. So here, culled from .zsh_history, those Themes and Packages that I have installed and not uninstalled over the last eight months or so:</p>
<p><a href="https://atom.io/themes">Themes</a> (used under bright ambient light, also Atom&rsquo;s built-in &ldquo;One Light&rdquo; UI)
[ccZSH]

[/cc]
Themes (used under bright ambient light, also Atom&rsquo;s built in &ldquo;One Dark&rdquo; UI)
[ccZSH]
❯ apm install isotope-ui
❯ apm install zenburn
[/cc]
Themes (basically unused; railscasts for nostalgia; github, because wihout it there would be no Atom)
[ccZSH]
❯ apm install inspired-github
❯ apm install railscasts-theme
[/cc]
<a href="https://atom.io/packages">Packages</a>
[ccZSH]
❯ apm install open-in-browser
❯ apm install color-picker
❯ apm install csslint

            <description>So, I came across this site last night when scouting around for tools/sites that Eldest child might like to use as he gets to grips with programming, that is to do so without my necessarily having to hold his hand. The decisions I might make may or may not be reasonable or even appropriate. Better that he get a variety of experienced feedback from others (I will always be there), and in whatever language he chooses.</description>
            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>So, I came across this site last night when scouting around for tools/sites that Eldest child might like to use as he gets to grips with programming, that is to do so without my necessarily having to hold his hand. The decisions I might make may or may not be reasonable or even appropriate. Better that he get a variety of experienced feedback from others (I will always be there), and in whatever language he chooses.</p>
<p><a href="http://exercism.io">exercism.io</a> is, essentially a community. Programming exercise sets, in numerous languages, are submitted and vetted by the community. One downloads these exercises, writes code, and submits waiting for feedback. It is not a learning environment <em>per se</em>, well not in the &ldquo;instruct me&rdquo; sense at least.</p>
<p>I find it fascinating because it is NOT based on a spiffy AJAXed-up website with its own editing environment and submit process. One installs a simple CLI tool, and uses that to download and submit to <a href="https://github.com">git</a>. Submitted ruby code for calculating <a href="http://rosalind.info/problems/hamm/">hamming distances</a> in genetic sequences this AM to see how it all worked together, and it did. Flawlessly. I guess the downside is that one needs an environment set up on a machine, and a workflow, and #1 Son doesn&rsquo;t have that yet. That, and I don&rsquo;t think the problem sets would exactly tickle his curiosity.</p>
<p>There are several options for the CLI program install, one of which uses <a href="http://brew.sh/">homebrew</a>. I chose that, and in the process <a href="http://stephen.yearl.us/cleaning-up-a-homebrew-installation/">cleaned-up</a> a three-plus-year-old-install of that.</p>

<p>The three sons began to argue for seventeen doesn&rsquo;t divide by two. It doesn&rsquo;t divide by three. It doesn&rsquo;t divide by nine. In desperation, they went and they consulted a wise woman. she thought about their problem for a long time, and finally said, “Here, you can have my camel.”</p>
<p>So then they had eighteen camels. The first son took his half &ndash; half of eighteen is nine. The second son took his third &ndash; a third of eighteen is six. The youngest son took his ninth &ndash; a ninth of eighteen is two.</p>
<p>That’s seventeen camels. The one camel they had left over they gave back to the wise old woman.</p>

<p>Hmm. Tried connecting with a third-party blogging tool (<a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/pixelpumper/id595901917?mt=12">Pixelpumper</a>) and the same 403! This post is interesting, and the highest ranked answer (<a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9141497/wordpress-403-forbidden-error">http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9141497/wordpress-403-forbidden-error</a>) suggests trying the plugins. What fun.</p>
<p>I only uninstalled a few of the the most recently installed plugins back until I remember this not being an issue and still no dice, so it was back to Google, and it shortly became apparent that xmlrpc.php had been the target of a number of pingback DDOS attacks recently. I contacted my hosting provider, and sure enough they had disabled access to xmlrpc.php, but did offer the tantalising possible solution of obfuscating the name and location of xmlrpc, and installing a plugin, &ldquo;Rename XMLRPC&rdquo;:<a href="https://apps.wordpress.org/support/#faq-ios-12"> https://apps.wordpress.org/support/#faq-ios-12</a> Well, no dice here either!</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s something of a pain not to be able to use a third-party blog editor, but I am not at this often enough for that to be a real hassle. I guess the next thing to do is to dig into the structure of Ruby gems, and see if I cannot override the call to xmlrpc.php to some obfuscated version of it.</p>

            <description>We have been making miso soup for so long that, like many other cooked (rather than baked) dishes, we no longer follow recipes so much as we follow principles. Miso has been a winner in our house with the boys, and is a &amp;lsquo;go to&amp;rsquo; soup. It is a relatively rare day when there is not a pot simmering on the stove. It works as a warming drink around about breakfast time, a soothing drink about bed time, and it works as a decent starter to any meal.</description>
            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>We have been making miso soup for so long that, like many other cooked (rather than baked) dishes, we no longer follow recipes so much as we follow principles. Miso has been a winner in our house with the boys, and is a &lsquo;go to&rsquo; soup. It is a relatively rare day when there is not a pot simmering on the stove. It works as a warming drink around about breakfast time, a soothing drink about bed time, and it works as a decent starter to any meal. &lsquo;Porked up&rsquo; a little, it can even stand as a main, especially with a side of rice.</p>
<p>I cannot think of a dish that is lower in calories than this, but is equally filling. Like fresh tortillas the ingredients are simple (if you can get them), but there is some technique involved. If you cannot get the ingedients then don&rsquo;t bother; instant miso soup is an abomination, and is without doubt the foulest thing you will ever taste outside of a cucumber.</p>
<p><strong>Ingredients:</strong>
Konbu (kelp; <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dulse">dulse</a> if youse is from Ulster)
Bonito flakes
Filtered water
Miso paste <strong>miso paste is naturally gluten free, but some contain non-traditional ingredients, viz. barley (麦、mugi) or wheat (小麦、komugu)</strong>
Firm tofu
<em>Optional:</em>
Nori/ wakame/ seaweed of choice
Scallions/ spring onions
Meat of choice&ndash; very low fat pork loin chops we find ideal</p>
<p><strong>Method:</strong>
Again we are without accurate measurements, so these are &lsquo;ballpark&rsquo; estimates.</p>
<ol>
<li>Filter ~2L of cold water and set on a medium heat</li>
<li>Rdd ~100g of konbu and simmer until liquid is a pale green, and steam is rising from the surface</li>
<li>Remove the konbu and add a handful (50g ??) of bonito flakes</li>
<li>The bonito will rise then sink then rise again. At this point the broth (dashi) should be seived again, removing the bonito flakes.</li>
<li>The dashi can be used, at this point, for any number of things&hellip;. numer one here is that it goes towards miso soup, but we often use it instead of plain water to flavor rice</li>
<li>Remove some dashi to a separate bowl and slowly add ~50g of miso, whisking, adding back to the dashi</li>
<li>Add ca. 250/500g firm tofu that has been cut into 1cm cubes</li>
<li>Season with wakame or nori, slices into strips, and scallions</li>
<li>Add 1 cm cubes of VERY lean meat&hellip; we generally go for loin pork chops with all the fat removed. Not because we are squeamish about animal fat, but just because it detracts from the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Umami">umami</a> taste of the soup</li>
</ol>

            <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been playing with Hazel a bit recently, mostly so I can get a handle on it to support others&#39; usage of a simple file automation/ housekeeping application. I like it, but it is somewhat limited in not allowed nested conditional and other basic logic statements. Anyway, what Hazel does is not much more&amp;ndash; and very frequently less&amp;ndash; that what I&amp;rsquo;ve been doing with ad hoc cron scripts. These are not very tidy having built built up over the years.</description>

Anyway, what Hazel does is not much more&ndash; and very frequently less&ndash; that what I&rsquo;ve been doing with ad hoc cron scripts. These are not very tidy having built built up over the years.

$ ruby -v
ruby 1.8.6 (2007-03-13 patchlevel 0) [i686-darwin8.10.1]
[/cc]</p>
<p>This version corresponds to Apple&rsquo;s default on early 2008 Macbook Pros which came preinstalled with Leopard (OS X 10.5). I guess this shows that although I am running Mountain Lion now on a mid-2012 MBP I have not had a clean OS install since April &lsquo;08, and I have never done so myself on my own machine. So, proof that:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>I am lazy?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Upgrades work &lsquo;plenty fine&rsquo;, and Apple do a pretty good job in this regard?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I&rsquo;m scared of losing all the custom build of compilers, interpreters, symlinks, scripts in odd locations doing various things, settings galore… etc, etc. that make this machine mine?</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Think I&rsquo;ll persist on this path through Mavericks <em>then</em> start fresh with OS XI… if I am am still using an increasingly annoying Apple OS.</p>

            <description>Butterfly stitches out now&amp;hellip;. Still in the Duran-friendly dorsal blocking splint, wrist cocked @ 20º. More exercises! Largely these are Duran/ modified Duran protocol, i.e. passive flexion, semi-active extension. The three main rehab protocols seem to be:
  Duran: Controlled Passive Motion Methods
  Kleinert: Active extension, passive flexion by rubber bands
  Strickland: Early active ROM (range of motion)
  With the aim of full ROM by week 12.</description>

<li>
<p>Strickland: Early active ROM (range of motion)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>With the aim of full ROM by week 12. Basically it&rsquo;s a balancing act. Too much active flexion risks rupture, and too little leads to scaring and adhesion. But I should be getting ultrasound therapy twice weekly starting next week to break up scar tissue. W00t</p>
<p>And it would appear that external stitches of the Bruner incision counted 30, not the 25 I&rsquo;d mentioned earlier.</p>

            <description>In his exit speech on Jan. 17, 1961 Dwight D. Eisenhower warned us to be wary of the growing military industrial complex. Prescient words:
We must never let the weight of this combination endanger our liberties or democratic processes. We should take nothing for granted. Only an alert and knowledgeable citizenry can compel the proper meshing of the huge industrial and military machinery of defense with our peaceful methods and goals, so that security and liberty may prosper together.</description>

<p>Well, I am hereby sort of claiming &ldquo;narcojudicial complex&rdquo;, and I am more than a little surprised that it or its hyphenated form &ldquo;narco-judicial&rdquo; does not produce many Google results. I don&rsquo;t think I really need to define it. We all are aware of the huge size of the US prison population, the demographics of which include a very great number of non-violent, poor, drug offenders. Are dugs a social scourge? Very probably. Is mandatory incarceration for &ldquo;dime-bag&rdquo; worth it? I doubt it, but there see to be companies doing very well out of the privately run for-profit gaol system.</p>
<p>narcojudicial complex, narcojudicial complex, narcojudicial complex, narcojudicial complex, narcojudicial complex, narcojudicial complex, narcojudicial complex, narcojudicial complex, narco-judicial complex, narco-judicial complex, narco-judicial complex, narco-judicial complex. </p>

Now I want one! But @ basically $50 I think the Pegasus 6NN63 Clock, Quartz, Round is a little too pricey. Frankly there&amp;rsquo;s not really any point since we all use &amp;ldquo;military&amp;rdquo; time in this house anyway; it&amp;rsquo;s only purpose would be to remind the boys that there are many ways to visualize so common an object as a clock face… and maybe fsck with American visitors.</description>

            <description>They took out 25 stitches today and replaced them with the butterfly stitches to reduce superficial scaring. Nice of them, but skin scars do no really matter much to me. Anyway the big stuff:
  Flexor Digitalis Superficialis @ 2, 3 and 4 was completely severed as was the Flexor Carpi Radialis and the Flexor Digitalis Profundus of 3.
  FDP-2 and FDP-4 cut but not severed</description>

<p>Anyway the big stuff:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Flexor Digitalis Superficialis @ 2, 3 and 4 was completely severed as was the Flexor Carpi Radialis and the Flexor Digitalis Profundus of 3.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>FDP-2 and FDP-4 cut but not severed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>FDS-5 was damaged. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A portion of FDS-3 was transferred and sutured to FDP-3.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>All internal suturing was done with <a href="http://www.arthrex.com/fiberwire">FiberWire</a> using modified (Tajima) <a href="http://www.wheelessonline.com/ortho/flexor_tendon_repair_techniques_core_suture_techniques">Kessler grasping knots</a>.</p>
<p>No damage to nerves&hellip;. that&rsquo;s good news! Damed close call on the radial, however.</p>
<p>Back on July 23 to see the surgeon, and in the meantime I have hand therapy scheduled for this July 11 and the following Monday (July 15).</p>
<p>Fingers and wrist are immobilized in a splint&ndash; and will be for another six weeks, except for scheduled exercises.</p>
<p>Still fucking painful; still feels like molten lead is flowing through my forearm!</p>

            <description>Had surgery today to repair the severed tendons in my wrist yesterday. Full-on, no holds barred general anesthetic and two and a half hours under the knife of a very well respected orthopedic surgeon working out of New England Baptist Hospital. General anaesthetic worked like a charm, but I wish that i had more time to enjoy it. About 5 minuted of pre-anaesthesia sedative and then some pure oxygen. The last number I remember counting to was only 3!</description>

<p>The pic. here is the temporary suturing done  at Newton-Wellesley ER after clean up and glass removal, a small infusion of blood and my first experience with percocet. Sunday June 23, 2013, a day not to be forgotten.  It&rsquo;s a teaching hospital, and Mr. K. asked for my consent to have videos/ photographs taken of the proceedings for later classroom use. I agreed on the proviso that I get copies of any materials so used.</p>
<p>I wish I had the foresight to take a photo before these temporary stitches were put in. As I watched the physician stitch away I was quite taken with the depth of the wound, and the weirdness of trying to wiggle my fingers knowing that the index, middle and ring fingers were not actually connected to flexor muscles anymore.</p>
<p>Follow up meeting in two weeks time. Until then it&rsquo;s Rest, Ice, Compression, Elevation, and lots of HBO reruns with my new best friend Percocet 5/325. The nerve block on the right brachial plexus before seeing me home last night is starting to wear off. That&rsquo;s good in that I can move my arm, bad in that it feels as though molten lead is pouring through my veins.</p>
<p>Since typing is a royal pain in the arse, I&rsquo;m just going to copy &ldquo;what happened&rdquo; from a FB message I sent to a friend:</p>

<p>[cc_bash]df -k /dev/sdb2[/cc] reveals 1% usage so I guess I have lost all my data. But have I lost my drive?</p>
<p>[cc_bash]ls -la /dev/sdb2 shows a huge .journal file[/cc]</p>
<p>Remounting the disk under OS X 10.8.3 &hellip;. indicates a blank HPFS+ volume. Yeah, OK, so I lost  a backup and a few files outsides of that, but all in all not a bad result. At least the drive is not hosed!</p>
<p>Well aparently it is. After a full time machine backup one of my lovely children knocked out the connecting USB cable, the drive was unceremoniosly unmounted and was again beyond Disk Utility&rsquo;s repair. Drive Genius (3.2.2, BTW) <em>was</em> able to rebuild it, but this situation is not tenable. I cannot trust the drive/file system/cable to be reliable, and if there is anything one needs in a backup it is reliability.</p>
<p>I think my next steps are to use <a href="http://www.bombich.com/">Carbon Copy Cloner</a> to clone my HD to yet another drive, take this dodgy Western Digital Passbook drive, reformat it as a non-journaled FS (FAT 32, if Time Machine can work with that), and see how improperly unmounting the drive affects its contents.</p>

<ul>
<li>A falsehood</li>
<li>&ldquo;bucket&rdquo; containing all that is important to a given culture&ndash; may be universally true; it certainly is specific to a given cultural identity</li>
<li>Something fundamental (or primal) about our condition. Also primal as in &ldquo;old&rdquo;, &ldquo;primitive&rdquo;</li>
<li>μυτηος&ndash; literally speech; later a narrative speech/story; still later, specifically a false story; later still&ndash; a tall tale, but with some elemental truth</li>
<li>Constantly re-invented for the ages/different cultures; always a re-telling. E.g Hercules from Heracles.</li>
</ul>
<p>Mediterranean&ndash; &ldquo;the corrupting sea&rdquo; (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Corrupting-Sea-Study-Mediterranean-History/dp/0631218904">book of same name</a>). There is no cultural/linguistic purity. The Med. is a great interconnecting force leading to the mingling of cultures and ideas, of stories and languages and ways of interpreting the world.</p>
<p>Oedipus&ndash; metaphor for man&rsquo;s quest for knowledge, ever asking.</p>
<h5 id="13-some-ancients-on-myth">1.3 Some ancients on myth</h5>
<p><strong><em>Plato (Πλάτων ca. 428 - 348 BCE)</em></strong>: Generally critical of the poets, largely considered myths to be pretty indecent, having a powerfully deleterious effect on culture and cultural values. <strong>Myth constructs culture</strong>.</p>
<p><strong><em>Xenophanes of Colophon (Ξενοφάνης ὀ Κολοφώνιος ca. 570 - 475 BCE)</em></strong>: Almost the reverse of Plato in that it is our culture, environment and experience that shapes our myths. He notes that egyptian gods are black, and that if cattle could speak and reason, so their myths would be cattle-like. <strong>Culture reflects/constructs myth</strong>.</p>
<p><strong><em>Metrodorus of Lampascus (Μητρόδορθς Λαμπψακησος 5th BCE)</em></strong>: Myths are symbolic (allegoric) representations of deep truths and understandings of the world. As such they might be considered &ldquo;pre-scientific&rdquo;. E.g. Achilles is the Sun, Helen the Earth, Demeter the liver, Dionysus the spleen. <strong>Allegory</strong>.</p>
<p><strong><em>Aristarchus of Samothrace (Ἀρίσταρχος ca. 220 - 143 BCE)</em></strong>: Established historically important critical editions of Homer… hence the modern lit. crit. term &ldquo;aristarch&rdquo; for a judgmental critic. Believed myths to be literally stories for stories' sake, and that they had no hidden meaning. <strong>Literary/ anti-allegorical</strong>.</p>
<p><strong><em>Euhemerus (Εὐήμερος 4th BCE)</em></strong>: Myth is based on real events, places and peoples that over time have taken on unreal or exagerated tones. Like, perhaps, the Bible. In the sense that the gods are deified mortals/heros one might consider beatification/canonisation a similar process&hellip; <strong>Euhemerism</strong>.</p>
<p>Of these beliefs, euhemerism and allegorical interpretation held the majority sway in the pre-modern, post-antique era. During the medieval period the graeco-roman myths and legends were generally just considered <em>fabulae</em>, tall tales with perhaps a nuggets of wisdom therein.</p>
<h5 id="14-some-moderns-on-myth">1.4 Some moderns on myth</h5>
<p><strong><em>Bernard de Fontanelle (1657 - 1757)</em></strong>: Myths grew  to explain the natural world, helping to explain the unexplicable. In this sense he considered myth to be <strong>proto-science</strong>.</p>
<p><strong><em>David Hume (1711 - 1776)</em></strong>: Slap-bang in the middle of the high Enlightenment he was impatient with myth, and discounted myth as primitive and superstitious thought, the result of comforts and erroneous and irrational assumptions now superseded by logic and rationality.** Myth is an Irrational response to fear of the unknown**.</p>
<p><strong><em>Christian Gottlob Heyne (1729 - 1812)</em></strong>: A classicist in the, err, classical sense. Was generally interested in the ancient world, and one can&rsquo;t understand the ancients without trying to understand every part of them, especially the &lsquo;background&rsquo;, that myths provide. Myth is not so much driven by fear of the unknown as with Hume, but with awe and wonder of nature. Resurrected μυτηος for use instead of the much more limited <em>fabula</em>. <strong>Myth is the concretization of the abstract</strong>.</p>
<p><strong><em>Johann Gottfried Herder (1744 - 1803)</em></strong>: Somewhat anti-elightenment, and a precursor ro the Romantic spin on graeco-roman myths and legends; viz. myth undergird profound truths about the human spirit,  express an innate characteristic of humans identical to poetry, music, art, and religion. <strong>Romantic</strong>.</p>
<p><strong><em>Walter Burkert (1931 - )</em></strong>: scholar of Greek myth, U. Zurich. Myth is a traditional tale told with secondary partial reference to something of collective importance told by someone for some reason.  <strong>Definition used in this course.</strong></p>
<h5 id="15--17-trojan-war--reading-homer"><strong>1.5 / 1.7 Trojan War / Reading Homer</strong></h5>
<ul>
<li>Trojan War &ndash; 13th BCE</li>
<li>Homer &ndash; 8th BCE</li>
<li>Athens &ndash; 5th BCE</li>
<li>(Classical) Rome &ndash; 1st BCE/CE</li>
</ul>
<p>Heinrich Schliemann (1822 - 1890) unearthed in the 1870s the remnants of a city in Asia Minor (Turkey) consistent with the age and location of Troy; also &ldquo;Priam&rsquo;s Treasure&rdquo; in 1976, a stash of gold and ornaments and such.</p>
<p>Trojan War takes place over ten years, the Iliad compresses these to about three days. Helen&rsquo;s face said to launch 100 ships, therefore approx. 100, 000 Greek warriors. First word is Μῆνις (wrath), and in the Epic tradition the first word sets the tone for the rest of the poem. The wrath in question might rightly be Menelaus' (from whom Paris abducted Helen, Menelaus' wife), Agamemnon&rsquo;s (who as Menelaus' brother also feels his shame), or more likely Achilles'. Achilles' wrath is all encompassing, although he does bend a little toward Priam, assenting to allow him to perform the customary funereal rites on his son, Hector.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Prequel&rdquo; for the Iliad is Helen&rsquo;s abduction. Paris feels free to do this because of a bargain with Aphrodite. At the wedding of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peleus">Peleus</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thetis">Thetis</a> (a sea nymph, nereid) the pantheon is invited except Eris (goddess of discord, lit. &ldquo;strife&rdquo;). She tosses an apple &ldquo;for the fairest&rdquo; (τῇ καλλίστῃ) amongst the guests. Aphrodite, Athena and Hera ask Paris to choose, and he in return gets something. He chooses Aphrodite who promises the most beautiful mortal woman to him. … Athena is somewhat maltreated later by the Greeks&ndash; he palladium is stolen from her temple at Troy (thus removing Athena&rsquo;s aegis of protection over that city), and Ajax rapes princess Cassandra on her altar.</p>
<p>By and large Homer does not gloss over Greeks poor behavior in the Iliad; his recollection of event is not particularly complimentary, with the internal squabbles and the various profanities to Athena and Neptune. Homer has no problem relating that the Greeks went too far, even by their own standards.</p>
<p>The Nostoi (from νοσςος, home): <em>journeys' home</em>. Nestor gets an easy ride home. Menelaus gets blown of course to Egypt. Agamemnon faces horros on his return. Odysseus faces trials and tribulations on his way back, recounted in the Odyssey… first word &ldquo;man&rdquo;, Ανδρα, thus indicating that the Odyssey is about what it is to me a man.</p>
<p>Homer writes in dactylic hexameter, some 15k lines in the Iliad, 12K in the Odyssey. Dactyl is long-short-short, and a spondee (long-long) may replace a dactyl. He write in several dialects, principally Ionic and Aeolic. He was probably writing very shortly after the arrival of the alphabet from the Phoenicians that supplanted the (Cretan) Linear A and Linear B, pictographic systems not used for literary works, but rather for recording events and tracking accounts and such.</p>
<p>First ten lines of Odyssey and Illiad encapsulate each poem.</p>

            <description>So, I&amp;rsquo;ve signed up for &amp;ldquo;Greek and Latin Mythology&amp;rdquo; from U. Penn at coursera.org. It should be an interesting diversion in these times of my doing relatively little. A little Homer, Aristarchus, Thucydides, Aristophanes, Vergil, Ovid and the like would be welcome relief. Read all&amp;ndash; or almost all&amp;ndash; of these in English translation as a late teenager, and some of the Latin authors in the original. The Greek however… well, I never got very far with that in High School.</description>

Hmmm. 45 minutes until soccer/football practice. Warm-ish spring evening. We need something filling, something quick, so why not try something I&amp;rsquo;ve never made before: corn dogs. So, with Simply Red&amp;rsquo;s Fairground on loop in the background we begin&amp;hellip;
Slice 4 lamb sausages lengthways, and fry. Remove them before they are fully cooked, and set aside to cool on an absorbent material to soak up the excess fat.</description>

<p>Hmmm. 45 minutes until soccer/football practice. Warm-ish spring evening. We need something filling, something quick, so why not try something I&rsquo;ve never made before: corn dogs. So, with Simply Red&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3JlpDr84Pk">Fairground</a> on loop in the background we begin&hellip;</p>
<p>Slice 4 lamb sausages lengthways, and fry. Remove them before they are fully cooked, and set aside to cool on an absorbent material to soak up the excess fat.</p>
<p>[caption id=&ldquo;attachment_457&rdquo; align=&ldquo;aligncenter&rdquo; width=&ldquo;300&rdquo;]<a href="http://sjy.yearl.us/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/IMG_2312.jpg"><img src="http://sjy.yearl.us/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/IMG_2312-300x225.jpg" alt="Sausages"></a> Sausages[/caption]</p>
<p>That was easy. Actually it is not <em>that</em> easy; it depends on where you live. Getting decent sausage can be devilishly hard sometimes.</p>
<p>Now the wrapping:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>250g <a href="http://www.mimaseca.com/es/productos-maseca/d/maseca-maiz-regular/1">Maseca masa harina</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>250-ish ml chicken stock</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>herbs and spice to taste</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I mixed the harina with freshly ground black pepper, smoked paprika, salt and thyme, then added the stock (at room temperature) bit-by-bit until I had a masa/dough with roughly the consistency of kids' play dough. This turned out to be about 250ml, but this will vary, obviously, on the ambient humidity and such.</p>
<p>Take one young child, and have him press the masa around the sausages:</p>

<p>Next we&rsquo;ll deep-fry the &ldquo;wrapped&rdquo; sausages. I used peanut oil as it has a higher smoking point than other common oils, but I guess whatever you have to hand will do&hellip;sunflower, rape seed (canola), anything except perhaps olive oil. (Yes that&rsquo;s a bottle of 95% ABV ethanol in the foreground&ndash; THE best grease/crayon/marker remover!)</p>

<p>All in all, for something so fast and so simple, the results were fantastic. The squeals of delight coming from the boys when they discovered that the masa wrapping would serve as a ice cream cone of sorts was nothing short of fantastic. We&rsquo;ll be making this again!</p>

<p>We waited a few hours for the pool to open. The pool opens at 11 am and closes at 5 pm.
At 11am the pool was not open so we had to tell him to open the pool. We got in the pool long time then we got out bout some goggles then we got back in the pool for the rest of the day.
The we went to a restrount then I had mochi for desert.
I made two new friends</p>

            <description>This is a picture of my aunt Beth on a broken part of the Great Wall. My mom took this picture. This is the wall at Shanhaiguan. That is where the wall meets the sea. This does not look like pictures of the Great Wall I have seen because it does not really look like the Great Wall. It does not have the watch towers or the fence-like things on the sides of the wall.</description>
            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://sjy.yearl.us/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Great-wall_010.jpg"><img src="http://sjy.yearl.us/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Great-wall_010-1024x662.jpg" alt="Great wall_010"></a> <a href="http://sjy.yearl.us/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Great-wall_020.jpg"><img src="http://sjy.yearl.us/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Great-wall_020-1024x662.jpg" alt="Great wall_020"></a></p>
<p>This is a picture of my aunt Beth on a broken part of the Great Wall. My mom took this picture. This is the wall at <a href="http://www.travelchinaguide.com/china_great_wall/scene/hebei/shanhaiguan/">Shanhaiguan</a>. That is where the wall meets the sea. This does not look like pictures of the Great Wall I have seen because it does not really look like the Great Wall. It does not have the watch towers or the fence-like things on the sides of the wall. It looks like an ordinary rock bunched into a wall. My mom used to have a piece of the wall from here, but she can&rsquo;t find it now.</p>
<p><a href="http://sjy.yearl.us/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Great-wall_0005-e1364904828211.jpg"><img src="http://sjy.yearl.us/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Great-wall_0005-e1364904828211-716x1024.jpg" alt="Great wall_0005"></a></p>
<p>This is a picture of the Great Wall of China that is not crumbling. This is on a piece of money. I think that the Ming built the wall that is on the picture of the wall on the money.</p>
<p><a href="http://sjy.yearl.us/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Great-wall_0009-e1364904660728.jpg"><img src="http://sjy.yearl.us/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Great-wall_0009-e1364904660728-1024x462.jpg" alt="Great wall_0009"></a></p>
<p>This is an old map of China showing the Great Wall and it winds around the top of China. And you can see how it kept the Mongols out.</p>
<p><a href="http://sjy.yearl.us/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Great-wall-e1364904763902.jpg"><img src="http://sjy.yearl.us/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Great-wall-e1364904763902-707x1024.jpg" alt="Great wall"></a></p>
<p>My grandmother also went to the Great Wall. She went to a different part. She was sick and the people on the bus said she needed a partner to take her around the wall. My grandmother wanted to go one way and her partner wanted to go another way. My grandmother and her partner lost each other.</p>
<p>My Auntie Beth says &ldquo;there&rsquo;s a Chinese saying that you&rsquo;re not a man until you go to the Great Wall, and yet your uncle, who grew up in China, has never been.&rdquo; One day I would like to climb the Great Wall.</p>

            <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve had Windows 7 running under the Parallels VM for quite some time now&amp;ndash; just for those odd occasions when I might need to do something on that platform like, err, watching streaming European association football matches from servers in the the Middle East. (I am perhaps one of few Brits who do not bristle when I hear North Americans call football &amp;ldquo;soccer&amp;rdquo;, because, &amp;ldquo;soccer&amp;rdquo; is derived from &amp;ldquo;association&amp;rdquo; football, and was used once upon a time to distinguish itself from that other footballing code: rugby.</description>

(I am perhaps one of few Brits who do not bristle when I hear North Americans call football &ldquo;soccer&rdquo;, because, &ldquo;soccer&rdquo; is derived from &ldquo;association&rdquo; football, and was used once upon a time to distinguish itself from that other footballing code: rugby.</p>
<p>I never particularly worried about internal backup of the Windows stuff, because it is a pretty naked install, with the usual stuff added:</p>
<p><a href="www.clamav.net/">ClamAV
</a><a href="http://www.cygwin.com/">Cygwin
</a><a href="http://windirstat.info/">WinDirStat
</a><a href="http://www.piriform.com/ccleaner">CCleaner
</a><a href="http://notepad-plus-plus.org/">Notepad++
</a><a href="https://www.google.com/intl/en/chrome/browser/">Chrome
</a><a href="http://www.emptyloop.com/unlocker/">Unlocker
</a><a href="http://www.macrium.com/reflectfree.aspx">Macrium Reflect Free</a><a href="http://www.emptyloop.com/unlocker/">
</a><a href="http://www.poweriso.com/">PowerISO
</a><a href="http://www.daemon-tools.cc/eng/products/dtLite">DAEMON Tools Lite</a></p>
<p><em>MSFT Office 2010&hellip; and Visio</em></p>
<p>and the whole VM was backed up as part of the usual Mac backup (via <a href="http://www.bombich.com/">Carbon Copy Cloner</a>). However, I found the need for an image of this system this morning, and in going through the usual route of creating an ISO in Win 7 I was somewhat surprised to see that the outcome would be a whopping 46GB. What to do? WellI found a pretty damned helpful page at Scott Hanselman&rsquo;s Computer Zen, <a href="http://www.hanselman.com/blog/GuideToFreeingUpDiskSpaceUnderWindows7.aspx">Guide to Freeing up Disk Space under Windows 7</a>. Particularly:</p>
<p>[cc_dos]cd /d %TEMP%
cd ../
rd /s temp[/cc]</p>
<p>couple of files could not be deleted in this directory&hellip; one that was open by ClamAV, so shutting that down did the trick. Also [cc inline=&ldquo;true&rdquo;]FXSAPIDebugLogFile.txt[/cc] was locked. The following steps fixed that:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Go to Control Panel</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Click on Program</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Click On “Turn Windows Features On and Off”.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Navigate to Print and Document Services</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Now uncheck that option</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Now click Ok to confirm</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Restart the computer</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Identifying the processes that had these files open was pretty straightforward, but oftentimes this is <em>not</em> the case, then I recommend the free <a href="http://www.emptyloop.com/unlocker/">Unlocker</a>. It adda a contextual menu to Windows Explorer that will identify the process that is using any particular file: very useful if one ever comes across &ldquo;The file is in use by another program or user&rdquo;, or &ldquo;Cannot delete file: Access is denied&rdquo;, or some such.</p>
<p>After following Scott&rsquo;s advice, I&rsquo;d saved about 10GB. Not enough. A running of WinDirStat identified one huge file and one large directory. The file was [cc inline=&ldquo;true&rdquo;]20100314201842.vdmk[/cc], the directory [cc inline=&ldquo;true&rdquo;]arc_20100314201842[/cc]. Being prudent I duplicated my Win732.pvm, deleted these files, crossed my fingers and restarted Parallels. And all was good with the world! Win 7 ran faster in the VM, and the size of the resulting ISO was a <em>much</em> improved 12GB, 3 DVDs worth.</p>
<p>If you find these files (your names will be different, these are obviously timestamps) in your Parallels VM, IT IS SAFE TO REMOVE THEM! I suspect they are left over from when I was toying with <a href="http://www.vmware.com/products/fusion/overview.html">VMWare Fusion</a> and <a href="https://www.virtualbox.org/">VirtualBox</a>. If[cc_bash inline=&ldquo;true&rdquo;]*vmdk[/cc] does not look like &ldquo;Virtual Machine DisK&rdquo; I do not know what does.</p>
<p>And as for the initial ISO creation when I installed win 7 in parallels back in 2010: The contents of the install CD were copied to a temp dir on the Mac, Disk Utility was used to create a DMG file, and then an ISO was created using [cc_bash]hdiutil convert /path/to/file.dmg -format UDTO -o /path/to/file.iso[/cc] It seemed faster to go this route as I had a soft copy of the install disk, and anything coming of off the hard drive was obviously going to install faster that the original install medium.</p>

            <description>Since summer I&amp;rsquo;ve been running a little minecraft server on a VPS in the UK. It is a pretty low-end system, and I didn&amp;rsquo;t imagine more than a handful of the primary school chums of 74111101 playing on it. A nice, secure, white-listed place away from the craziness of the net. As is inevitable with such things, numbers grew and shrank. I was waiting for a stable population before setting something more concrete&amp;ndash; allocating relevant resources, branching out into mods and so forth.</description>
            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Since summer I&rsquo;ve been running a little minecraft server on a VPS in the UK. It is a pretty low-end system, and I didn&rsquo;t imagine more than a handful of the primary school chums of 74111101 playing on it. A nice, secure, white-listed place away from the craziness of the net. As is inevitable with such things, numbers grew and shrank. I was waiting for a stable population before setting something more concrete&ndash; allocating relevant resources, branching out into mods and so forth.</p>
<p>Well, the population is yet to stabilise. I neglected to factor-in the the volatility of elementary school relationships, and how flat-out nasty little boys can be. Some of the wonderful worlds created by x player have been thoroughly destroyed by y and z&hellip;. and on and on. EVERYONE wants to be an &lsquo;op&rsquo;, and of course it just take one rogue op to spoil the fun for all. Why a single user on a multiplayer server would want to ban everyone else is beyond me. OK, so you have the server to yourself. Have fun. Next time try playing off-line.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to say that my boys have not been involved in this miniature world politicking, but they have not. They understand the power of root, but still 74111101 has handed out op privileges like candy, and has frequently found himself banned from the server I set up for him. And even with recognition of confirmation bias, I think I am right to say that I &lsquo;picked&rsquo; those kids who were going to be trouble IRL/AFK as being trouble online. If I were a sociologist&hellip;.</p>
<p>Anyway the following mathematica code came my way via email&hellip; a cousin&rsquo;s friend. It is a little sluggish using Mathematica 8.0.4.0 32bit on OS X 10.8.2, but then I am giving over a fair amount of CPU/GPU cycles to CERN&rsquo;s computing grid, and that is also taking about 25% of my network throughput right now.</p>

            <description>For whatever reason, I&amp;rsquo;ve bumped into a number of in-browser [latex]\LaTeX[/latex] editing tools recently. I guess these are mostly useful for collaborative efforts, and I can see a reason why one would not want to use Subversion or Git. I mean Eldest is just coming of an age where he&amp;rsquo;s seeing computers as tools for his own use rather than just vectors of games/educational materials/movies. Because I am a benevolent father-dictator, he&amp;rsquo;s already familiar with [latex]\LaTeX[/latex] (and actually loves Computer Modern), and has decided to set all his writings in [latex]\LaTeX[/latex] prior to submission.</description>

Good for him. I love the fact that he was complaining about fonts on the MacBook Airs at school, and the pain of writing in MS Word. Good boy!</p>
<p>So, rather than having him use my tool chain, which is very much tied to my laptop and <a href="http://texstudio.sourceforge.net/">TeXstudio</a>, we could use one of these. I might even be able to persuade his Grade IV teacher that [latex]\LaTeX[/latex] is something worth introducing to the kids in its own right. She was, after all, blown away by 74111101&rsquo;s Christmas writing piece that we set in [latex]\LaTeX[/latex]. I guess I&rsquo;ll make notes as I evaluate each below and add them here.</p>
<p>[latex]\LaTeX[/latex] can, apparently, be embedded in WP using shortcodes &lt;<a href="http://en.support.wordpress.com/latex/">http://en.support.wordpress.com/latex/</a>&gt;, but neither of the below &ldquo;codes&rdquo;, for example appear to work out-of-the-box on self-hosted WP sites:</p>
<p>[cci_latex theme=&ldquo;default&rdquo;][latex]\LaTeX[/latex]
$latex \LaTeX$[/cc]</p>
<p>So I installed two WP LaTex plugins: <a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/easy-wp-latex-lite/">Easy WP LaTeX</a> and <a href="http://www.holoborodko.com/pavel/quicklatex/">QuickLaTeX</a> (also <a href="http://quicklatex.com/">http://quicklatex.com/</a>).</p>
<p>QuickLaTeX is <em>by far</em> the crisper of the two, and is what is used for the LaTeX symbol on this page.</p>
<p>[latex]\LaTeX[/latex] rendered w/ QuickLaTeX
[math]\LaTeX[/math] rendered w/ Easy WP LaTeX</p>

<p>Of course setting up Wordpress was a breeze.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Set up a blank MySQL database with an admin user</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Then on the server with the webserver (in my case Apacehe2)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>[cc_bash]</p>
<p>mkdir sjy
cd sjy
wget <a href="http://wordpress.org/latest.tar.gz">http://wordpress.org/latest.tar.gz</a>
tar xzf latest.tar.gz
cd wordpress
mv * ..
cd ..
rm -rf wordpress
mv wp-config-sample.php wp-config.php
vi wp-config[/cc]</p>
<p>Setting the login details of the MySQL database. And that is that. Went on into install the Suffusion theme for Wordpress (because although I do not intend to style this, my wife&rsquo;s gluten-free cooking blog uses Suffusion) and the <a href="http://kpumuk.info/projects/wordpress-plugins/codecolorer/">CodeColorer</a>  plugin.</p>

Several highly organized civilizations flourished in North, Central and South America, all without wheat which was unknown to them.

<p>Corn (maize) tortillas have to be the quintessential American bread. American as in &lsquo;from the Americas&rsquo;, not &lsquo;USiAn&rsquo;. Several highly organized civilizations flourished in North, Central and South America, all without wheat which was unknown to them. Maize was their staple, and alongside beans, a grass somewhat resembling rice, and potatoes in the South. With these sources of complex carbohydrates who would want for wheat (or barley)?</p>
<p>Of these cultures and culinary traditions practically only one survives, that of the Nahua (Aztec, if you insist), and that is amalgamated with Spanish traditions to form the wonder that is Mexican food. Stuck for a G-F meal? Look no further than Mexico.</p>
<p>We bought a tortilla press many years ago from <a href="http://www.zabars.com/">Zabar</a>&rsquo;s in NYC. It was made of aluminium, cost about $20 and broke on its first outing. Sad to say we never made tortillas again&hellip; until this morning and, like the <a href="http://mary.yearl.us/gluten-free-granola/">granola</a> and the <a href="http://mary.yearl.us/gf-oatcakes/">oatcakes</a> we are again finding our palms firmly smacking our heads. WHY did we not do this before? The difference in flavor between these puppies and the corn tortillas we have been subsisting on from Trader Joe&rsquo;s is like the difference between cheese and chalk. These tlaxcalli are sublime, especially the first run off the comal, slathered with farm butter.</p>
<p><strong>Ingredients:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><a href="http://www.mimaseca.com/es/productos-maseca/d/maseca-maiz-regular/1">Masa harina</a> (very fine maize flour)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Salt</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Warm water</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ratio of water to harina was ~ 1.2 : 1 (350ml : 300g)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Lest I upset any real Mexican that happens to find this page, we used Maseca (masa seca = dry dough, if you ask me) brand masa harina, but that is not real masa harina&hellip; it is itself an &lsquo;instant&rsquo; dough (masa) flour (harina), that has some other ingredients added, most notably lard. But it is close enough for me. To be any more authentic we&rsquo;d have to grow our own corn (done that, actually), and develop a nixtamalization process.</p>
<p><strong>Method:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Add water bit by bit until a dough resembling kids' playdough is formed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Break off small pieces of dough and form golf-ball sized spheres</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Flatten into a circle to your required thickness (our first batch varied a <em>lot</em>)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Cook on a comal/griddle* until golden and delicious, or</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>partially cook on a a griddle, making a batch that can be further grilled at a more convenient time.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>We were given a very thin steel comal by a Mexican friend several years ago that I swear was beaten out of an old trashcan lid, and this did the trick perfectly as it was very quick to heat up and cool down. That is rusting overseas right now, so we have co-opted an old cast iron griddle that has been used solely for making sincronizadas (quesadillas).</li>
</ul>
<p>Ah, method. #3 is the one to watch out for here. Since we are without a tortilladora two alternate methods were tried.</p>
<p>#1 Rolling pin: The first was rolling out a tortilla on a floured surface. This was entirely unacceptable as the dough is very frangible and frequently tore, and even when it did not, the shape is irregular, and it makes a mess. We are looking for a quick and clean method so that making tortillas becomes second nature, making it next to no hassle to make a fresh batch for breakfast before the kids head off to school in the mornings.</p>
<p>#2 <em>Ad hoc</em> press: The second method was opening up a 1 gallon (US ~ 3.78L) zip lock bag, and placing a ball of masa between the layers. The ball was then pressed flat with body weight behind a cast iron skillet. This led to circular tortillas, but considerable stress on our work surface. It seems pretty clear that the real way to go is to get a tortilla press. Internet &lsquo;research&rsquo; thus far seems to indicate that a heavy wooden press made of mesquite wood would be ideal&ndash; most reviews of cast iron tortilladoras indicate a problem with the handle snapping under compression, just like our old aluminium press.</p>
<p>And a little light reading: <a href="http://bidi.xoc.uam.mx/tabla_contenido_libro.php?id_libro=284"><em>Breve historia de un invento olvidado: Las máquinas tortilladoras en México</em></a></p>

            <description>Well it does not get any simpler than this, well maybe the granola is, but it is yet another example of a face-plant. Almost every trip to the supermarket in the UK led to the purchase of several boxes of oatcakes. Why? Why did we not think of making these before? Again the impetus has been going gluten-free since, as you might have guessed, the majority of easily/commercially available oatcakes have wheat flour in them.</description>

Again the impetus has been going gluten-free since, as you might have guessed, the majority of easily/commercially available oatcakes have wheat flour in them.</p>
<p><strong>Ingredients:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>225g gluten-free oats</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>10g butter</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>1/2 tsp salt (nix if using salted butter)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>1/2 tsp bicarbonate of soda</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>100ml warm water</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Method:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>‘Biltz’ the oats in a food processor to break them up into a meal/flour</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Add other dry ingredients, and give the processor a few spins to mix</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>pre-heat oven to 180 ºC ≈ 350 ºF</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Add warm water to the butter to melt, and add liquid to dry ingredients to form a dough</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Roll out the dough to ca. 0.5cm thickness, cut using desired size of cookie cutter</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Place oatcakes on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper and bake for about 25 minutes</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>NOTE: It is important to move quickly with the oatmeal dough as it dries out VERY quickly.</p>
<p>Set to cool on a rack, and enjoy!</p>
<p><a href="http://sjy.yearl.us/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/oatcakes.jpg"><img src="http://sjy.yearl.us/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/oatcakes-1024x556.jpg" alt=""></a></p>
<p>The following updated ratios lead to a more malleable dough. Much improved over the above, and just perfect with some damson jam and a glob of clotted cream.</p>
<p><strong>Ingredients (2015-10-27):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>250g gluten-free oats</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>25g butter</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>1/2 tsp salt (nix if using salted butter)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>1/2 tsp bicarbonate of soda</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>1/2 teaspoon xanthan gum</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>130ml warm water</p>

            <description>Lest y&amp;rsquo;all think that everything works out in our GF kitchen, I&amp;rsquo;ve decided to add that the following did not. Well, not quite. The bread is darned tasty, and is wonderful toasted with a bit of fresh butter. We are BIG butter fans, especially locally made stuff (not Cabots or Land o&#39; Lakes, or anything &amp;lsquo;stick&amp;rsquo; form, really), the sort of butter that is pretty close to tasting of cheese.</description>
            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Lest y&rsquo;all think that everything works out in our GF kitchen, I&rsquo;ve decided to add that the following did not. Well, not quite. The bread is darned tasty, and is wonderful toasted with a bit of fresh butter. We are BIG butter fans, especially locally made stuff (not Cabots or Land o' Lakes, or anything &lsquo;stick&rsquo; form, really), the sort of butter that is pretty close to tasting of cheese.</p>
<p>I think it is really just a question of getting the right flour combination down, and practising technique. Bread making is hard enough to get right with regular wheat flour, let alone with the added complexity of a bread sans gluten.</p>
<p>As it was <a href="http://www.goldenspurtle.com/world-porridge-day/">World Porridge Day</a> we went with the following:</p>
<p><strong>Ingredients:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>80g GF porridge oats</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>150g rice flour</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>50g tapioca flour</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>60g buckwheat flour</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>1tsp GF baking powder</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>1tsp xanthan gum</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>1 tsp honey</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>1 packet dried bakers' yeast</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>50g butter</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>30g sesame seeds</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>1/2 tsp salt</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I should repeat again that we use a nifty <a href="http://www.polyvore.com/bamboo_kitchen_scale/thing?id=37829006">electronic scale</a>, which is just so convenient for baking. Place on a bowl, zero (or &lsquo;tare&rsquo;) it, add ingedient, zero once more&hellip; add ingredient. Rinse and repeat.</p>
<p><strong>Method:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Set the yeast in a warm sugar solution and cover</p>

<p>A few thoughts for next time&hellip; Higher oven temperature at least initially. Buckwheat is, we think, a little bit heavy. Perhaps 50g less rice flour, and replace that deficit AND the tapioca for 100g of potato flour. Maybe also leave out the sesame seeds (add a little sesame oil instead), and give longer for the yeast to really get going.</p>

            <description>One can&amp;rsquo;t have Thanksgiving without cornbread. This recipe comes as a surprise: I picked up a bag of almond meal whilst shopping and decided to try it as a straight substitute for flour in cornbread. Normally, I use some combination of tapioca flour, garbanzo flour, masa, or any of the other GF powders I have lying around.
With almond meal in hand, I surfed up a couple of recipes, and used this one for inspiration.</description>

<p>With almond meal in hand, I surfed up a couple of recipes, and used <a href="http://shecookshecleans.net/2011/10/11/gluten-free-skillet-cornbread/">this</a> one for inspiration. The result? A nice, surprisingly moist, cornbread that was good enough to reheat and enjoy the following day. This one really hit the spot.</p>

<p><strong>Ingredients:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>100g (1/2 cup) each of white and yellow cornmeal (could use 200g/1cup of either)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>75g (3/4 cup) almond meal</p>

<li>
<p>1 tsp. baking powder</p>

<li>
<p>1 tsp. salt</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>2 large eggs</p>

<li>
<p>250 ml (1 cup) buttermilk</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>25g (2-3 tbsp.) honey</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>85g unsweetened applesauce [NOTE: Recipe calls for: 60g (4 tbsp) unsalted butter, melted and really this should have meant about 70g applesauce, but I had extra to use up.]</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>grease for the skillet (I used ~ 1 tbsp bacon fat)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Other possible additions: bacon bits, cheese, corn, hot peppers&hellip;anything else that strikes your fancy.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>** Method: **</p>

<ol>
<li>
<p>Preheat the oven to 425F/218C</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Put 1 tbsp fat in the skillet and place in the oven to heat</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Whisk together the dry ingredients in a large bowl</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Mix the eggs, milk, and honey in a separate bowl</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Stir the wet mixture into the dry, then add the melted butter and mix thoroughly</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> When the fat in the skillet is sizzling hot, pour in the batter</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Cook until the bread is golden on top and firm in the middle. (The recipe said 15-20 mins, but with the extra applesauce, I cooked ours for 30 mins.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Serve straight from the pan! (Or not.)</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>And, voilà!</p>

            <description>Please, someone, tell me why I did not make granola earlier: for years, I have shied away from purchasing the stuff at the store because it all seems too “fancy” with artificial fruit flavours, etc., that simply do not appeal.

<p>¼  c. chopped almonds</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>¼ cup dark brown sugar</p>
</li>

</li>
<li>
<p>Warm the oil and syrup, then pour it slowly over the oats mixture while stirring.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Stir together with a spoon, then make it uniform by using your hands.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Spread the mixture evenly on a baking tray (or trays).</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>For the liquid sugar, try agave, honey, molasses, or treacle.</p>

            <description>When we wanted a gluten-free graham cracker crust for our key lime meringue pie, we looked to Gluten-Free Girl because we wanted a recipe that included the making of graham crackers, rather than a trip to the store for ready-made, GF graham crackers. We followed that recipe pretty closely and came up with crackers that looked like this:

I am often imprecise with measurements, but note them as closely as I can.</description>

We followed that recipe pretty closely and came up with crackers that looked like this:</p>
<p><a href="http://sjy.yearl.us/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/Graham-crackers.jpg"><img src="http://sjy.yearl.us/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/Graham-crackers-300x225.jpg" alt=""></a></p>
<p>I am often imprecise with measurements, but note them as closely as I can. A few grams on either side should not make a difference. This is the recipe for graham crackers as I followed it, which has a few modifications from the one referenced above.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>70g garbanzo flour</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>70g tapioca flour</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>70g white rice flour</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>½ teaspoon xanthan gum</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>¼ teaspoon guar gum</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>½ teaspoon cinnamon</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>1 teaspoon baking powder</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>½ teaspoon salt</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>100g melted butter</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>85g honey</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>3-6 tablespoons cold water</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Method</strong>:</p>
<p>Preheat the oven to 325F/160C</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Whisk together the dry ingredients</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Cut the butter into the mixture until the texture is mealy. It’s easiest to do this in a food processor.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Combine the honey and a few tablespoons of cold water and pour it into the batter while mixing.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Keep mixing until the dough sticks together in a ball: add more water if necessary.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Roll the dough into two balls. Wrap each dough ball and cool in the refrigerator for 15 minutes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Remove the dough from the fridge and roll it out (one ball at a time) on a parchment paper lined baking sheet. The flattened dough should be about 1/8 to 1/4 inch thick.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Cut the dough to match the pattern you want for your graham crackers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Refrigerate the rolled out dough for 15 minutes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Prick the dough all over with a fork.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Bake the graham crackers until they are golden and firm to the touch.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Remove from the oven and cool on the baking sheet. They should become quite crisp.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Verdict on the result: the kids liked them, but I&rsquo;m going to work with the recipe. It&rsquo;s probably me, or perhaps my mixture of flours, but I found them to be a bit dense. That said, we made them mainly so that we could make graham cracker crumbs, and for that they were great.</p>
<p><strong>The graham cracker crust</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>200g graham cracker crumbs</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>115g unsalted butter</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>2 tablespoons sugar</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Method</strong>:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Blitz the graham cracker crumbs, butter, and sugar, in a food processor until uniformly mixed. The crumbs should hold together when pressed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Pour into a pie dish and press up against the bottom and sides.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We did not pre-bake this, but it can be browned at 375F/190C for 5-10 minutes if desired.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Once pressed into the dish, the crust looked like this:</p>
<p>[caption id=&ldquo;attachment_270&rdquo; align=&ldquo;alignleft&rdquo; width=&ldquo;225&rdquo;]<a href="http://sjy.yearl.us/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/GF_Graham_crust.jpg"><img src="http://sjy.yearl.us/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/GF_Graham_crust-225x300.jpg" alt=""></a> The pie crust, before pouring in the key lime mixture.[/caption]</p>
<p>The pie was lovely, and disappeared quickly. I&rsquo;ll still work to improve this recipe, though. The crust was a bit dense, which may be because my own measurements of butter and sugar were off, or because the graham crackers I worked with were dense.</p>

            <description>We can thank STS-133 for our family&amp;rsquo;s appreciation of key lime pie. While we did see it launch in the end, our first journey to Florida included a trip to the Keys while we waited to hear whether the mission would go ahead. That first trip may end up being the first and last time we sample proper Key Lime Pie, but we&amp;rsquo;ll continue to experiment on our own versions that bring us back to Islamorada.</description>
            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>We can thank <a href="http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/shuttle/shuttlemissions/sts133/main/index.html">STS-133</a> for our family&rsquo;s appreciation of key lime pie. While we did see it launch in the end, our first journey to Florida included a trip to the Keys while we waited to hear whether the mission would go ahead. That first trip may end up being the first and last time we sample proper Key Lime Pie, but we&rsquo;ll continue to experiment on our own versions that bring us back to Islamorada. The current recipe is not key lime pie, even if it was inspired by that dessert. First, key limes were out of season and therefore not available. Secondly, we decided to add a meringue using the leftover egg whites. That and Joseph was very much into the &lsquo;science&rsquo; of meringues.</p>
<p>[caption id=&ldquo;attachment_241&rdquo; align=&ldquo;aligncenter&rdquo; width=&ldquo;225&rdquo;]<a href="http://sjy.yearl.us/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/Cooked_Lime_meringue1.jpg"><img src="http://sjy.yearl.us/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/Cooked_Lime_meringue1-225x300.jpg" alt=""></a> The finished product[/caption]</p>
<p> The recipe we followed was based on <a href="http://allrecipes.com/recipe/easy-key-lime-pie-i/">this</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>5 egg yolks</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>14 oz. (1 can) condensed milk</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>1/2 cup (key) lime juice</p>
</li>
<li></li>
</ul>
<p>Method:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F/190 degrees C</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Beat the yolks, then add in condensed milk and lime juice and mix thoroughly.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Pour the mixture into a <a href="http://mary.yearl.us/gluten-free-graham-cracker-crust/">graham cracker crust</a> (we mostly followed the recipe from <a href="http://glutenfreegirl.com/gluten-free-graham-crackers/">Gluten-Free Girl</a>).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Bake for 15 minutes, then let cool.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Whip the egg whites (after adding some green food coloring to keep in theme) and 1/4 cup of icing/confectioners' sugar until stiff, and forming peaks. Spread on top of the pie.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Bake until golden brown (10-15 minutes)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="http://sjy.yearl.us/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/Cooked_lime_pie-300x275.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>Right, so our crust was a bit large, and the consistency of the crust was such that it flopped over onto the pie filling. We rather liked the effect, one child claiming that it looked a bit like some weird planetoid. In any event, we covered all of this with the colored meringue.</p>
<p><strong>Modifications</strong>: for a start, we try to use key limes! That said, the slightly milder taste meant that everyone in the family liked this one. One time we included rind and made an incredibly intense pie. I&rsquo;d recommend that for anyone who wants pie tasting to be an experience.</p>

            <description>Gluten-free beef pasties. (This is one where you’ll have to use your own judgment regarding amounts: we just threw it together, but the addition of lamb stock made the filling especially rich. The point of this post? You can be gluten-free and still feed that craving for a pasty.)

</li>
<li>
<p>Red wine</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Lamb stock (made with bones from yesterday’s lamb chops)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Peas and parboiled carrots and potatoes (we used small new potatoes)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>[caption id=&ldquo;attachment_146&rdquo; align=&ldquo;alignnone&rdquo; width=&ldquo;225&rdquo; caption=&ldquo;We tossed the beef in gluten-free flour&rdquo;]<img src="http://sjy.yearl.us/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/IMG_03762-225x300.jpg" alt="">[/caption]</p>
<p>Filling (method):</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Dice the meet into small- and medium-sized cubes</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Toss the beef in gluten-free flour</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Brown the beef in oil/fat</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Remove the beef from the pan and deglaze with red wine</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Restore beef to the pan</p>

<li>
<p>Add lamb stock, carrots, peas, and potatoes</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Cook until the mixture is nice and thick</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Preparing the pasties:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Roll out pastry (look at other entries for gluten-free pastry)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Cut the dough into large ovals (roughly double the size you want your pasty to be)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Spoon a heap of filling onto one half of each cut-out portion of dough, being careful to leave room at the edges</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fold the remaining dough over the filling so that you can crimp the sides together to create a filled packet of pastry</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Brush the pastry with milk if desired</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Bake at about 400 degrees Fahrenheit until the pastry is golden</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>Note: gluten-free pastry does not hold together as well as regular pastry, so you will probably want to eat these on a plate with a knife and fork, for they are unlikely to stay together if you try to eat them with your hands.</p>

            <description>[TYPES]
Virginias usually represent the highest percentage in a blend. Although there&amp;rsquo;s a wide range of Virginias to choose from, including bright VA&amp;rsquo;s, matured VA&amp;rsquo;s, and stoved VA&amp;rsquo;s, in general the lighter the color the tangier the taste, with the darker VA&amp;rsquo;s lending a deep, rich note to the blend. Unprocessed VA&amp;rsquo;s tend to produce tongue bite, and stoved VA&amp;rsquo;s tend to bite much less.
Burley, like VA, is a good base tobacco.</description>
            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>[TYPES]</p>
<p><strong>Virginias</strong> usually represent the highest percentage in a blend. Although there&rsquo;s a wide range of Virginias to choose from, including bright VA&rsquo;s, matured VA&rsquo;s, and stoved VA&rsquo;s, in general the lighter the color the tangier the taste, with the darker VA&rsquo;s lending a deep, rich note to the blend. Unprocessed VA&rsquo;s tend to produce tongue bite, and stoved VA&rsquo;s tend to bite much less.</p>
<p><strong>Burley</strong>, like VA, is a good base tobacco. It has no sugar of its own, but is relatively bite-free. It should never come to the forefront, but be used sparingly. The &ldquo;Burley Curse&rdquo; refers to the habit this tobacco has of overpowering a blend. Burley has a distinct nutty taste, but because of its somewhat bland character, is often flavored.</p>
<p><strong>Cavendish</strong> generally refers to a blend of various tobaccos that have been sweetened, stoved, and pressed. Unflavored black cavendish, for instance, is made from Kentucky Green River burley, which is sugared, steamed and toasted, yielding a distinct caramel flavor. In a blend, cavendish can be used sparingly, to add body or flavor, or become the base, yielding a sweet tobacco. It goes particularly well with Latakia.</p>
<p><strong>Perique</strong> is a &ldquo;spice tobacco&rdquo;, with a distinct peppery flavor. Produced mostly in Louisiana from various base tobaccos, and cured in its own juices, this not only adds spice to a VA blend, but also mitigates a lot of the bite that comes with it. When not part of a straight VA/Perique blend, it should only be added to the point that it becomes noticeable. In a regular VA/Perique blend, it can represent a higher percentage, though 10% is often enough.</p>
<p><strong>Latakia</strong> is Turkish tobacco flavored with smoke. Syrian Latakia is strong and bright, while Cyprian Latakia has a deeper, mellower flavor. This is another spice tobacco, and needs a base tobacco to keep it in check. Fifty percent Latakia would be considered a &ldquo;heavy Latakia blend&rdquo;. It&rsquo;s generally wise to use less Syrian than Cyprian.</p>
<p><strong>Oriental</strong> is spice tobacco from the Eastern Mediterranean (countries such as Turkey or Greece). Somewhat akin to Latakia, this is spicy and sweet. Most oriental tobacco is a blend. Even a label that refers to it as one distinct type (such as basma), is usually referring to its main component. Turkish is often used to fill out the general impression of a Latakia. Again, on its own, 50% would be considered a &ldquo;heavy Oriental&rdquo;.</p>
<p><strong>Maryland</strong> and Carolina can be thought of as &ldquo;filler&rdquo; tobaccos, used mainly to flesh out the taste of a VA or Burley base. Not terribly distinctive, these can be used to mitigate tongue bite.</p>

<hr>
<p>[CUTS]</p>
<p><strong>Cavendish</strong>- A very important process in today&rsquo;s tobaccos. Cavendishes, in older blends, generally referred to tobaccos which had been treated with flavorings or even sugar water, sometimes steamed (mainly in Black Cavendish), pressed, cut, and rubbed-out. These were the original aromatics. Through the years the term has become watered-down, and is commonly used to refer to any flavored tobacco blend.</p>
<p><strong>Flake</strong>- Tobaccos, normally whole-leaf, that have been pressed, and usually sliced, are called Flakes. The pressure aids in the maturing process, and brings out a richer flavor. The most common Flakes are based upon Virginias, and Virginia blends.</p>
<p><strong>Krumble Kake</strong>- Cut tobaccos which have been pressed are sometimes referred to as Krumble Kake. It is so named since a chunk of it can be easily rubbed-out into small pieces.</p>
<p><strong>Cubed</strong>- Pressed tobacco which has been cut into fine or coarse cube-shaped pieces is called Cubed, with the most common type being Cubed Burley. The thick, chunky pieces burn slowly, so Cubed tobaccos are normally quite cool.</p>
<p><strong>Rough Cut</strong>- Tobaccos cut into larger flat pieces are called Rough Cut. This cut burns slowly, and can be used to keep hotter tobaccos from burning too fast.</p>
<p><strong>Broad Cut- Wide, ribbon</strong> -cuts, which burn at an average pace, and pack well, are often called Broad Cut.</p>
<p><strong>Ribbon</strong>- Narrower than Broad Cut, it burns more readily (a good cut for tobaccos that don&rsquo;t burn easily), and packs well.</p>
<p><strong>Shag</strong>- A very stringy ribbon cut, Shag can easily pack too tightly, and burns easily. At one time Shag was considered an inferior cut.</p>
<p><strong>Twist, Roll Cut and Rope</strong>- All are rolled tobaccos, twisted (at least to some degree) to create pressure to help mature the tobacco. Sometimes the tobaccos are cased for flavor. They are normally cut into &ldquo;coins&rdquo;, and can be packed whole, or rubbed-out.</p>
<p>And two terms that are important to know-</p>
<p><strong>Casing</strong>- Referred to earlier, Casings are flavorings, sometimes using an alcohol base, that are added early in the processing. Casings are primarily used to add flavor to a blend.</p>
<p><strong>Top Dressing</strong>- Top Dressings are added toward the end of processing, and their main purpose is to enhance room note, or aroma.</p>

So, I purchased this pipe from Ebay at a reasonable price. This was the only picture of the pipe, and I was a little dissapointed to find that on the shank (on the other side, obviously) there was a sizeable chunk of filler, about 2mm in width, 1mm in height rouhtly in the shape of the outline of Autralia.
I was tempted to repackage it and list the item as described by the original seller and just hope that I managed to get my money back.</description>

<p>So, I purchased this pipe from Ebay at a reasonable price. This was the only picture of the pipe, and I was a little dissapointed to find that on the shank (on the other side, obviously) there was a sizeable chunk of filler, about 2mm in width, 1mm in height rouhtly in the shape of the outline of Autralia.</p>
<p>I was tempted to repackage it and list the item as described by the original seller and just hope that I managed to get my money back. But I didn&rsquo;t, for, you see, Capt. Kidd&ndash; despite the ridiculous name&ndash; is a &lsquo;seconds&rsquo; line of the famed <a href="http://pipedia.org/index.php?title=BBB">BBB</a> brand. BBB (Britain&rsquo;s Best Briars) is reputedly Britain&rsquo;s oldest trademark, with the more famous red triangle of Bass ale being second, and the first to employ an image. Funny how the two oldest trademarks are for products that involve smoking and drinking, is it not?</p>
<p>Filling her up with some of Rattray&rsquo;s <a href="http://tobaccoreviews.com/blend_detail.cfm?ALPHA=H&amp;TID=954">Hal o' the Wynd</a> (see the poem, below), I enjoyed a very nice smoke. It is a nice pipe&ndash; no gurgle, no hiss, no whistle. The air-hole is drilled dead on centre. I&rsquo;ll keep the pipe, but oh how the filler vexeth me.</p>
<p>There seems but one course of action open to me. Hop on over to youtube and get some instruction on rusticating the darn thing. Two videos were of immense help, the first proving it was do-able, and the second more confidence inspiring: so thanks to flieger671 for <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mtd3laeISuc">Pipe Carving - Appendix 1, Rustication</a> and soulmirrors for <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0VQYTczlj4&amp;lc">A Very Rustic Pipe Rustication</a>!</p>
<p>Step one was to remove the existing polish and stain, this I did with isopropyl alcohol and some sanding with 320 grit wet-and-dry paper. The stain was some old walnut wood stain I had lying around. I understand that pipemakers generally use alcohol-based leather dyes as this penetrates deeper into the briar, but this was all I had lying around.</p>
<p>Then I hacked at the briar in little semi-circles, randomly over the sueface of the briar with a 3mm chisel I found lying in the botton of a toolbox. I did try to use a power drill initially, one that I had clamped in a broken desk vice. Yes the drill fell out. Yes one more that one occasion the bit skidded along the bowl. No this was not safe.</p>
<p>After ten minutes of hacking and re-staining, first in &ldquo;antique pine&rdquo; and then again the walnut I had:</p>
<p>[caption id=&ldquo;attachment_209&rdquo; align=&ldquo;aligncenter&rdquo; width=&ldquo;500&rdquo;]<a href="http://sjy.yearl.us/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/rusticated_2.JPG.scaled1000.jpg"><img src="http://sjy.yearl.us/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/rusticated_2.JPG.scaled1000.jpg" alt="Capt. Kidd pipe &ldquo;rusticted&rdquo;"></a> Capt. Kidd pipe &ldquo;rusticted&rdquo;[/caption]</p>
<p>And I am pretty happy with that.</p>
<p>Oh, and of course I polished the stem. Starting with 600 grit emery cloth and running progressively though 600, 800, 1000, 1500, 2000 and finally 3000. Pictures do not do the stem credit. It is like black glass.</p>
<p><em>Hal o' the Wynd, he taen the field
Alang be the skinklin Tay:
And he hackit doun the men o' Chattan;
Or was it the men o' Kay?</em></p>
<p><em>Whan a' was owre he dichted his blade
And steppit awa richt douce
To draik his drouth in the Skinner&rsquo;s Vennel
At clapperin Clemmy&rsquo;s house.</em></p>
<p><em>Hal o' the Wynd had monie a bairn;
And bairns' bairns galore
Wha wud speer about the bloody battle
And what it was fochten for.</em></p>
<p><em>&ldquo;Guid-faith! My dawties, I never kent;
But yon was a dirlin day
Whan I hackit doun the men o' Chattan;
Or was it the men o' Kay?&quot;</em></p>

            <description>So. I inherited a few Peterson tobacco pipes from my father who has been gone a couple of years now. He had what one might call a modest collection, and all were smoked regularly. Nothing fancy &amp;lsquo;just for show&amp;rsquo; except one piece. Anyway, I decided that I would do my level best to clean a few of them. I did this just because I was bored&amp;hellip; but the more I read, the more interested I became.</description>
            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>So. I inherited a few <a href="http://www.peterson.ie/pipes/">Peterson</a> tobacco pipes from my father who has been gone a couple of years now. He had what one might call a modest collection, and all were smoked regularly. Nothing fancy &lsquo;just for show&rsquo; except one piece. Anyway, I decided that I would do my level best to clean a few of them. I did this just because I was bored&hellip; but the more I read, the more interested I became. To the point at which I have listed one on Ebay (pictured below), and have several of the remainer on what pipe smokers call a rotation. I&rsquo;ve been enjoying a bowl or two every night recently.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s something a bit geeky about pipe smoking, so many avenues to venture down. It is anything but casual, and surely the pipe smoker is the most encumbered of smokers with reamers and tampers and pouches, let alone the pipe itself. The arcanery of tobaccos, the lore, the literary allusions; the peace, the relaxation. It requires substantially more effort to enjoy a bowl of tobacco than to grab a quick ciggie at a rest stop on the highway. I like that.<a href="http://sjy.yearl.us/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/FILE0028.png"><img src="http://sjy.yearl.us/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/FILE0028.png" alt="FILE0028"></a> <a href="http://sjy.yearl.us/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/FILE0026.png"><img src="http://sjy.yearl.us/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/FILE0026.png" alt="FILE0026"></a></p>
<p>Yes, yes. &ldquo;Smoking kills&rdquo;, and I understand it is not a flowery death either. But that should be an individual&rsquo;s choice. Aftter enjoying a bowl of <a href="http://tobaccoreviews.com/blend_detail.cfm?ALPHA=S&amp;TID=1040">Squadron Leader</a> from some vintage briar wood that used to belong to your father, and that you have loving restored back to smoking condition you might think somewhat more liberally.</p>

Ingredients:

  50 g brown rice flour
  1/2 tsp baking powder
  1/2 tsp xanthan gum
  4 eggs</description>

<p><strong>Ingredients</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>150 g gluten-free flour[1]</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>50 g buckwheat flour</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>50 g brown rice flour</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>1/2 tsp baking powder</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>1/2 tsp xanthan gum</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>4 eggs</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>450 ml milk[2]</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>1 tbsp animal fat (beef dripping, lard)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>[1] I had exactly 150 g left of a large batch of GF flour I&rsquo;d made with: equal parts rice flour and garbanzo flour, plus a bit of corn starch to equal 150 g; 1 tsp each of xanthan gum and baking powder</p>
<p>[2] The non-GF recipe called for 150 ml milk and this is quite an increase. However, since many GF flours are very fine and have a high surface-to-volume ratio, they absorb more liquid than wheat flours. In order to achieve the proper consistency in the batter before setting, I added quite a bit of extra milk. I would suggest adding the liquid bit by bit&ndash; putting the extra in by additional 50-100 ml measures.</p>
<p><strong>Method</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Whisk together the dry ingredients</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Make a well in the middle of the flour mix, add the eggs, and beat the eggs together first, then with the flour</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Add the milk and mix until evenly blended and the batter is thin</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Let the batter set for about half an hour</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In this time, preheat the oven to 245 C or 475 F. [I started at 230/450 but went up to 260/500 after 15 minutes]</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>While the oven is heating up, put the animal fat in a cast iron skillet/frying pan</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When the oven is heated and the fat is sizzling, pour in the batter</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Place in the oven and cook for 20-30 minutes (original flour recipe called for 15-20, mine was in for 30)</p>
</li>
</ul>

Indeed, the existence of this blog is largely down to our desire to record those things that go well. For the record: I have not yet replicated those wonderful dumplings, but am working on it.</p>
<p><a href="http://sjy.yearl.us/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/Chicken-and-cornbuck-dumplings.jpg"><img src="http://sjy.yearl.us/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/Chicken-and-cornbuck-dumplings-1024x682.jpg" alt=""></a></p>
<p>Cornmeal buckwheat dumplings.</p>
<p><strong>Recipe 1: Cornmeal buckwheat soy dumplings</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>1/3 cup (75 g) yellow cornmeal</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>1/3 cup (35 g) soy flour</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>1/3 cup (55 g) buckwheat flour</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>1/2 tsp. baking powder</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>1 cup (60 g) grated suet</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>cold water (about 1/3 cup?)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Salt/pepper/seasoning to taste</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Method</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Whisk together the dry ingredients</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Mix in the suet until evenly blended</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Add cold water bit by bit until the dough just sticks together.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You should be able to shape the dough into small balls (see picture under recipe 2).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Drop the balls into a simmering pot of stew or soup</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Heat for 10-15 minutes at least, or until ready to eat</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The dumplings should float when ready</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Verdict</strong>: Tasty. We like the earthiness added by the buckwheat, and the hearty texture from the cornmeal. However, I do not expect these to hold up. If you want something that will turn into a thickener, these are perfect. I still need to work on the balance a bit, but this batch went down well.</p>
<p><strong>Recipe 2: Masa dumplings</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>1 cup gluten free flour (my mixture: 75 g masa harina; 5 g tapioca flour; 30 g garfava flour)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>1 cup (50 g) grated suet</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>pinch salt</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>pepper to taste</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Cold water</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Method</strong>:</p>
<p>See above: the same method applies for these as for the cornmeal buckwheat dumplings.</p>
<p>[caption id=&ldquo;attachment_127&rdquo; align=&ldquo;alignleft&rdquo; width=&ldquo;300&rdquo; caption=&ldquo;Mix the dough until it just comes together&rdquo;]<a href="http://sjy.yearl.us/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/Masa-dumpling-mix.jpg"><img src="http://sjy.yearl.us/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/Masa-dumpling-mix-300x200.jpg" alt=""></a>[/caption]</p>
<p>[caption id=&ldquo;attachment_129&rdquo; align=&ldquo;alignright&rdquo; width=&ldquo;300&rdquo; caption=&ldquo;Then form bite-sized balls&rdquo;]<a href="http://sjy.yearl.us/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/Masa-dumplings1.jpg"><img src="http://sjy.yearl.us/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/Masa-dumplings1-300x200.jpg" alt=""></a>[/caption]</p>
<p><strong>Verdict</strong>:</p>
<p>I actually made two versions of the masa dumplings: in one batch, I added a bit of xanthan gum and baking powder. Those fell apart immediately. The others had a nice texture and were quite light, but fell apart overnight. I suspect that masa is not the best flour to use but will need to do more tests to see if it is the culprit (a while back I had another batch of masa dumplings that fell apart). In other words, nice taste and texture, but only good for one meal. After that, they become thickener.</p>
<p><strong>Some notes:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The first thing is, note that when using weights there should be about double the weight of flour to fat (so, 100 g flour to 50 g fat). When using measuring cups, the amount of flour is about the same as fat (about 1 cup flour and 1 cup loosely shredded fat).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>From (1) it should be clear that the measurements for cups/weights do not always add up. This is because measuring cups are inherently less precise than scales. For instance, shredded suet has a lot of air in it, so don&rsquo;t worry too much that I have noted a 10g difference in weight for the suet used in two recipes where I estimated it to be &ldquo;about a cup&rdquo;. If in doubt, use scales; in most cases, it is fine to give or take a few grams or milliliters.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I do not normally use soy flour but had it to hand. For decent cornmeal dumplings, 1/3 cup cornmeal to 2/3 cup other gluten-free flour should work just fine. Fool around with different flours until you find a texture/taste that works for you.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>While I normally season the dumplings with black pepper, sometimes chili pepper, and with a dash of salt. I did not season the cornmeal buckwheat ones, and they tasted fine.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I am not convinced that the xanthan gum is necessary in the second recipe; baking powder may not be, either. Experiment!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you cannot get suet, try freezing and then grating butter. One normally thinks of the suet as being shredded, but I buy a large frozen chunk from a local farm shop and grate it on demand.</p>
</li>
</ol>

            <description>The boys like peanut butter and they like chocolate, but the peanut butter cups from the store are too sweet and too salty. Moreover, we like bittersweet chocolate, so we decided to make our own. After all, I had a bunch of mini muffin cups I&amp;rsquo;d picked up in the post-Christmas sale at IKEA.

This is a project the kids can help with: mine not only helped fill the cups, they were wholly responsible for the decorations.</description>

Moreover, we like bittersweet chocolate, so we decided to make our own. After all, I had a bunch of mini muffin cups I&rsquo;d picked up in the post-Christmas sale at IKEA.</p>
<p><a href="http://sjy.yearl.us/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/Peanut-butter-cups-e1329231241523.jpg"><img src="http://sjy.yearl.us/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/Peanut-butter-cups-e1329231241523-1024x682.jpg" alt=""></a></p>
<p>This is a project the kids can help with: mine not only helped fill the cups, they were wholly responsible for the decorations.</p>
<p><strong>Ingredients</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>1 cup creamy peanut butter, separated into two equal parts *</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>1 1/2 tbsp. butter</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>1 tsp. honey</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>One bag (about 2 cups) dark chocolate chips</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Some extra semi-sweet chips (to make a generous 2 cups of chips)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Roughly 4 oz. of milk chocolate (this I might remove from the recipe next time)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Decorations</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Mini muffin cups (sized to suit)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To be sure, one could substitute soy butter, sunflower butter, or something similar for those cases where peanut butter is unwelcome.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Method:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>In a double boiler,* combine chocolate and about half of the peanut butter</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Stir the chocolate peanut butter mixture until smooth</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In a separate bowl, combine 1/2 cup peanut butter, honey, and butter</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Mix until smooth (I put the bowl over the double boiler for a few minutes to speed up the process)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Using a teaspoon, drip the melted chocolate into the bottom of the muffin cups until just covered.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>At the end of this step, I rolled the cups around just enough to bring the chocolate up the sides, but this is not necessary</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Carefully put a small dab of the peanut butter mixture in the middle of each muffin cup. Be careful not to let the peanut butter touch the sides!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Drip the remaining chocolate over the peanut butter and fill the cup.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Finally, decorate if desired and put them in the refrigerator to set.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A microwave might work, too.</p>
</li>
</ul>

            <description>Shortly after going gluten-free, we tried Bob&amp;rsquo;s Red Mill gluten-free pizza crust. Having lived in New Haven for many years, we like pizza. Bob&amp;rsquo;s didn&amp;rsquo;t measure up, so that was it&amp;hellip;until now. This might not be apizza, but as long as we&amp;rsquo;re gluten-free we may have to settle for a bit less.

Having found a hit with buckwheat pancakes, I decided to try a buckwheat pizza crust. The recipe I adopted was basically the one described here, but without the garlic powder.</description>

<p>Having found a hit with buckwheat pancakes, I decided to try a buckwheat pizza crust. The recipe I adopted was basically the one described <a href="http://www.nourishingmeals.com/2009/12/thin-buckwheat-pizza-crust-gluten-free.html">here</a>, but without the garlic powder.</p>
<p><strong>Ingredients</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>2 ¼ cups (275 g) buckwheat flour</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>½ cup (60 g) tapioca flour</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>pinch salt</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>½ tsp. baking soda</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>1 ¼ cup (280 ml) warm water</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>¼ cup (85 ml) olive oil*</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>½ tbsp. honey</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>1 tbsp. cider vinegar</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>cornmeal (optional)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I used rosemary and peppercorn infused olive oil</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Method</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Preheat oven to 375°F (190°C)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Grease a baking tray and sprinkle with cornmeal (cornmeal is optional)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In a mixing bowl, whisk together the flours, baking soda, and salt</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In a medium-sized bowl, combine the water, oil, honey, and vinegar</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Add the wet to the dry ingredients and mix them until well blended</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The batter should be fairly moist</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Pour the batter onto the baking tray and spread it until even in thickness</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Pre-bake the crust for 15-20 minutes or until it seems just cooked</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Take it out and add toppings. I first spread olive oil over the crust, this time some I had left over from a tub of marinated mozzarella balls.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Once you’ve created your pizza, bake until the toppings look done, about 10-15 minutes.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The batter will be surprisingly runny.                                               I spread olive oil and cornmeal on the tray</p>
<p><a href="http://sjy.yearl.us/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/Buckwheat-batter.jpg"><img src="http://sjy.yearl.us/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/Buckwheat-batter-300x199.jpg" alt=""></a></p>
<p><img src="http://sjy.yearl.us/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/Cornmeal-base-300x200.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>This is how the batter looked before it went into the oven:             and this is how it looked after:</p>
<p><a href="http://sjy.yearl.us/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/Ready-to-pre-bake.jpg"><img src="http://sjy.yearl.us/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/Ready-to-pre-bake-300x200.jpg" alt=""></a></p>
<p><a href="http://sjy.yearl.us/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/Prebaked-crust.jpg"><img src="http://sjy.yearl.us/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/Prebaked-crust-300x200.jpg" alt=""></a></p>
<p>I was a little sneaky. My kids don’t normally eat carrots, so I grated one and spread it on top of the crust where I could hide it. I did the same with some diced fresh tomatoes:</p>
<p><a href="http://sjy.yearl.us/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/Carrots-and-tomatoes.jpg"><img src="http://sjy.yearl.us/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/Carrots-and-tomatoes-300x200.jpg" alt=""></a></p>
<p>The sauce I used was a combination of homemade red sauce and Trader Joe’s Organic Marinara with no salt added. Other toppings included fresh mozzarella, grated cheddar, and bacon. I added sliced jalapeños to my corner.</p>
<p><a href="http://sjy.yearl.us/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/Ready-to-eat.jpg"><img src="http://sjy.yearl.us/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/Ready-to-eat-300x199.jpg" alt=""></a></p>
<p><strong>The verdict</strong>: two very happy boys. Neither noticed the carrots and their only complaint was that the toppings fell off too easily. In terms of the crust, it tasted good but was not like a traditional crust because the texture was somehow dense yet light at the same time. It’s possible that I didn’t pre-cook it for long enough, so next time I&rsquo;ll go for a golden look. Overall, I found it to be nice and manageable. Unlike so many other crusts, the boys could cut up their slices without any problem. It was soft, yet not soggy. I’ll have to play around with this one to make it a bit thinner and crispier, but it seems like a winner. Not too shabby the morning after, either.</p>

            <guid>http://localhost:1313/buckwheat-pancakes/</guid>
            <description>We are big lovers of cornmeal pancakes in our family, but the boys were hankering for something closer to traditional wheat ones, so we figured it was time to throw together a batch of buckwheat pancakes.

Yield: 7 large pancakes
The ingredients:
  1 cup (120 g) buckwheat flour
  ½ cup (20 g) masa harina
  ¼ tsp. baking soda
  2/3 tsp. baking powder</description>

</li>
<li>
<p>½ cup (20 g) masa harina</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>¼ tsp. baking soda</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>2/3 tsp. baking powder</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>pinch of salt</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>1 tbsp. maple syrup</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>1 ¼ cup (300 ml) milk</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>1 tbsp. butter, melted</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>3 eggs*</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The original recipe called for 1 egg, but I wanted additional egg whites to make the pancakes nice and fluffy. I did add the yolks to the batter, but one needn’t do so.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Method.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Whisk the dry ingredients together in a bowl.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Mix together the milk, syrup, melted butter, and egg yolk in another bowl.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Combine the wet and dry ingredients and stir until they are just mixed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Beat the egg whites until they are stiff but not dry</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fold the egg whites into the batter until just mixed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Cook away! We use a cast-iron griddle on medium-high heat</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>These went down very well indeed, though next time I might alter the mixture to make them more crêpe-like, as requested by one of the lads.</p>

            <description>[singlepic id=69 w=320 h=240 float=center]
So, school for Joe and Sam was out early today and we thought this afternoon an appropriate time to put the model rocket that Joe and Stephen put together over the weekend out for its maiden launch. There was quite some interest amongst Joe&amp;rsquo;s 3rd Grade class as Mary yesterday had helped Joe at his &amp;ldquo;show and tell&amp;rdquo;, where he told his peers about the launches he has been apart of, both at structured events like at Goddard Space Flight Center, MD, and also private launches with his friends and family.</description>

<p>This pictures from this afternoon&rsquo;s launch are in this gallery: <a href="http://mary.yearl.us/sr-71-blackbird-launch/">http://mary.yearl.us/sr-71-blackbird-launch/</a>.</p>
<p>We had three flights, each using B6-4 motors. Given the mass of the model (0.79 KG with motor), a B-class motor seemed the most appropriate for the maiden launch. The fact that we were in a rather small area with other folk' children present, and we were unsure of the zoning restrictions placed on such activity also led us to the rather lower thrust motor. In hindsight a B6-2 would have been perfect for the afternoon as the four second delay until recovery parachute deployment was a little too long: wice the model took a nose dive and planted itself firmly in the ground.</p>
<p>Wikipedia has more information on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_rocket#Motor_nomenclature">model rocket engine nomenclature</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_rocket#Motor_nomenclature">classification</a>. Basically, the letter indicates class of rocket in impulse velocity. The first letter he average thrust, and the final number represents the delay from engine thrust burnout until ignition of the ejection charge (and therefore recovery parachute deployment.</p>

            <description>Going to be changing ipv4 addresses a lot over the next little while, so I&amp;rsquo;ve decided to try a different v4-6 brokering arrangement. he.net&amp;rsquo;s tunnelbroker has been rock solid and I&amp;rsquo;ve been using it on and off since &amp;lsquo;08, but I think it time to try something else.
The ideal would be a self-monitoring client that identifies local ipv4 changes here (kind like a dynDNS client might), and renegotiate an ipv6 endpoint to tunnel through based on that change.</description>

<p>The ideal would be a self-monitoring client that identifies local ipv4 changes here (kind like a dynDNS client might), and renegotiate an ipv6 endpoint to tunnel through based on that change. he.net&rsquo;s configureation is a little more static than that, and there is no API that I can see that I can hook into to write that client myself. I sure as hell am not going the &lsquo;scrape screens&rsquo; route for this.</p>

            <description>TiGeRrrr gave me a model SR-71 Blackbird for Christmas and Aye-Dye built it this weekend. Thank you Tiger and AyeDye. I hope we can launch it on Tuesday because that&amp;rsquo;s when we get home from school early. Mimi found out we can launch it at the baseball diamond. My favorite plane is the F-14A Tomcat. Sammy&amp;rsquo;s is the Blackbird because it is faster but it cannot land on an aircraft carrier like the CVA-12 Hornet we went on in Alameda California.</description>

<p>The rocket was from <a href="http://www.estesrockets.com/">Estes</a>,  probably the biggest name in the US for amateur rocketry at this very introductory level. One can pick up pretty much everything one needs for an &gt;cough&lt; explosive afternoon of fun for less than $50. The squeals of delight alone is worth the price admission. So, below in a few pics, the &ldquo;soup to nuts&rdquo; o' the project.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d say putting this together was pretty damned simple. It&rsquo;s not exactly&hellip;. drum-roll&hellip; rocket science. It can get a bit fiddly, and sharp blades and patience and fast-curing adhesives do not work well in the hands of any little human less than say 10 years old. One slip with a razor blade and the fun sort of goes away does it not? With all the adhesive curing and the sanding and the spray-painting and such we were all pretty much ready to fly after about 48 hours.</p>

In some of the other pictures here and in the <a href="http://mary.yearl.us/sr-71-blackbird-model/">gallery</a> for this project there are clamps of various sorts, and spray paints.</p>

It seems unlikely that the 1.5mm edges of the wood will adhere, but the wood blue we used produces a bond stronger than the balsa itself. If the wing assemblies split anywhere, it will not be at the glued interface.</p>

<p>with a thin sheet of cardboard to give the impression of a uni-body design. To the lateral edges of these inner wings are attached the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nacelle">nacelles</a>.</p>
<p>It was curiously hard to get those elastic bands to hold those 1.5mm wings to a circular surface. It helped that we allowed the poly cement to become a little tacky before the wings were attached, but still there was some slippage, and one wing rides a little higher than another. This is not obvious once the skin is applied.</p>
<p>The edges of the skin were later sanded flat to the balsa wood on edges that were to be bonded to the nacelles.</p>

<p>The air intake spikes and nacelle exhausts are cut from a single piece of plastic. The carboard cylinder was a little wider that the plastic components, so the circumference of these was increased with two wraps of masking tape. Again the problem of gluing a narrow surface to the curved edge of a cylinder, but lessons were learned from earlier and some clamps were used instead. Arguably this was easier than when adding the inner wings to the central tube, because the inner wings were that much thicker after the addition of the wing skin.</p>
<p>The rudders were later glued onto the nacelles at a slight inward angle, and counterbalancing fins added to the underside of the model:</p>

<p>If ye have a Mac and you need batch processing, like say the images in this post try sips in Terminal.app:
<code>$ sips -Z 800 *.JPG -i -s format png --out /Users/sjy2/Desktop/SR-71-rocket-imgs/png</code></p>
<p>Which basically says take every jpeg in the current directory, make the longest axis 800 pixels (preserving aspect ratio), also create a PNG version, and copy the results to a directory on my desktop.

            <description>There is a chicken curry bubbling on the stove, saffron rice steaming away in the rice cooker: how can I not think of naan bread?

I surfed up a recipe for gluten-free naan bread, and this is what I found: http://www.food.com/recipe/gluten-free-naan-roti-indian-flat-bread-version-1-189334
I spent less than 30 minutes from start to finish, and in the end we had 2 large and 3 smaller naan breads.The final recipe looked like this:</description>

<p>I spent less than 30 minutes from start to finish, and in the end we had 2 large and 3 smaller naan breads.The final recipe looked like this:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>150 ml warm (but not hot) milk</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>60 g tapioca flour</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>85 g buckwheat flour</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>90 g brown rice flour</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>100 g white rice flour</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>1 tsp gluten free baking powder</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>1/2 tsp salt</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>1 generous tsp xanthan gum</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>1 tsp caster sugar</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>1 packet (about 2 tsp) active dry yeast</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>2 tsp olive oil (infused with rosemary and peppercorns)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>1 egg, lightly beaten</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>150 ml plain yoghurt</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>extra rice flour to prevent sticking</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Process:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Preheat the oven to 500 fahrenheit; preheat baking trays</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Heat the milk on a simmer burner until it&rsquo;s just warm, but not hot.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Remove from heat and stir in sugar and yeast. Let it sit for about 5 minutes</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>While waiting for the yeast mixture, combine in a large bowl: flours, baking powder, salt, xanthan gum. If you don&rsquo;t have a sifter, whisk them around until evenly blended.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Add to the flour mixture: yoghurt, egg, oil, and the milk mixture, and combine until smooth.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the dough is sticky, dust your hands with rice flour and shape the dough into balls, then spread out until they are uniform patties about 1 cm thick. Shape them as you please, but try to make all roughly the same size and thickness.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Place the patties on the pre-heated baking tray and place in the oven for 3 minutes, or until they are puffy and slightly browned.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Broil them for about a minute, or until nicely golden.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Optional: brush them with olive oil, ghee, or anything else that strikes your fancy. As with the mixture, I used olive oil infused with rosemary and peppercorns.</p>
</li>
</ol>

<p>After about 3 minutes, the bread had puffed up nicely and were ready for browning under the broiler.</p>

<p>Yeah, well. Turns out that &ldquo;registry rocket&rdquo; is an automated system to allow resale of Enom&rsquo;s services, and afraid.org, in order to make a little extra cash, had used this system. Of course by this point I&rsquo;d already gotten my epp code and had selected <a href="http://dynadot.com">http://dynadot.com</a> to be my new registrar.</p>
<p>Deal, still not done what to do? Current registration is a little more expensive, but I&rsquo;m supporting <a href="http://freedns.afraid.org">freedns.afraid.org</a>. Solved with teh resolution that I&rsquo;ll donate some subdomains and send a few $$ in their general direction. Plus, I get to try out this whole transfer business&hellip; never done that before.</p>

            <title>Gluten-free Christmas pudding</title>

            <description>Even though this is our first gluten-free Christmas, we didn&amp;rsquo;t want to miss out on the pudding. So, we made our own. I was apprehensive, but need not have been.

The basic recipe I followed was this one. Note that you have to scroll down the page quite a ways to actually reach the recipe.
I also had this one on hand and my final result combined aspects of both and may have included some improvisation re: dried fruits.</description>

<p><a href="http://sjy.yearl.us/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/GF_Xmas_pud.jpg"><img src="http://sjy.yearl.us/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/GF_Xmas_pud-1024x715.jpg" alt=""></a></p>
<p>The basic recipe I followed was <a href="http://www.jamieoliver.com/recipes/member-recipes/Gluten%20Free%20Christmas%20Pudding/1414">this</a> one. Note that you have to scroll down the page quite a ways to actually reach the recipe.</p>
<p>I also had <a href="http://britishfood.about.com/od/christmas/r/xmaspud.htm">this one</a> on hand and my final result combined aspects of both and may have included some improvisation re: dried fruits.</p>
<p>For the breadcrumbs, I followed a recipe very similar to the one for cornmeal croutons listed on <a href="http://www.celiac.com/articles/340/1/Corn-Bread-Stuffing-Gluten-Free/Page1.html">this</a> page.</p>
<p>If you need a shortcut, I have had some success with Glutino GF crumbs elsewhere: we used them in some fantastic crabcakes, but that&rsquo;s another story.</p>
<p>For the proper flavour in any Christmas pudding, it is important to start early. I did not, so I can say that 2 weeks of maturing time was just about enough. I did top up with brandy every few days to help the process! If you want a nice, rich, flavour, the cooked pudding should mature for at least a month. The great thing about this process is that you can make them several months in advance and they will continue to mature. Just check on them from time to time, add a bit more brandy along the way, and you&rsquo;ll have a warm belly and happy tastebuds come Christmas.</p>
<p>On the day itself, we plopped the pudding in the steamer and let it sit for a couple of hours (really, it only needs heating, so half an hour should do it) and it was fine. When we were ready, we turned out the lights, poured on the brandy, and flambéed the pudding. We had ours with whipped cream this year, though normally we have brandy butter.</p>
<p>For those unaccustomed to a Christmas pudding, it is very rich and you&rsquo;ll want to eat only a small amount at a time. Just a few bites and you should be sated.</p>

            <description>How did we do it? First of all, I picked up a new kitchen scale. It&amp;rsquo;s digital and switches easily between metric and US standard units. This makes it easy to fool around with different types of gluten-free flour since the only thing that really matters is that there be double the mass of flour to fat.
Right. What about those pies?
  Cranberry mince pies. For the filling, I pretty much followed the recipe given here.</description>
            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://sjy.yearl.us/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/GF_mince_pies.scaled1000.jpeg"><img src="http://sjy.yearl.us/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/GF_mince_pies.scaled1000.jpeg" alt="Mince pies"></a></p>
<p>How did we do it? First of all, I picked up a new <a href="http://www.polyvore.com/bamboo_kitchen_scale/thing?id=37829006">kitchen scale</a>. It&rsquo;s digital and switches easily between metric and US standard units. This makes it easy to fool around with different types of gluten-free flour since the only thing that really matters is that there be double the mass of flour to fat.</p>
<p>Right. What about those pies?</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Cranberry mince pies. For the filling, I pretty much followed the recipe given <a href="http://oaktree-cottage.blogspot.com/2008/12/nigellas-cranberry-mince-pies.html">here</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I also made traditional mince pies (again, GF pastry) inspired by <a href="http://britishfood.about.com/od/christmas/r/mincemeat.htm">this</a> recipe.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I may have added some prunes into the mix and also currents. I did not use any candied fruit and had to substitute Granny Smiths for Bramleys.</p>
<p>We are fortunate to have access to a great farm stand that sells excellent quality locally-raised meat at reasonable prices. I bought a large block of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suet">suet</a> from them. When I need a bit, I just take the block out of the freezer, grate what I need, and put the rest back for later.</p>
<p>For the pastry, I played around a bit. In the last batch, I combined roughly equal parts of:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Rice flour (white and brown)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Garbanzo (chickpea) / fava bean flour</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Added in a bit of corn starch</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The above three ingredients came to about 150gm.</p>
<p>Then I put in a couple of teaspoons of:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>xanthan gum</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>baking powder</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Now for the fat. I&rsquo;m not sure if it made much difference, but I froze all of my fat (lard and butter).</p>
<p><strong>Total fat used: 75 gm</strong></p>
<p>Sometimes I used only butter, sometimes a combination of lard and butter. The latter was a bit crumblier, as you might imagine.</p>
<p>Rather than cut the fat through the flour, I grated it, or at least sliced it into tiny pieces before cutting through the flour.</p>
<p>I did use my fingers for less than a minute to crumble the mixture together, then added the cold water&ndash; about 5-6 tablespoons and mixed everything together with a fork.</p>
<p>One the mixture held together, I separated it into two balls and put it in the fridge.</p>
<p>Half and hour later, I was ready to roll.</p>
<p>One note of warning: gluten-free pastry is not as pliable as regular pastry because of the lack of gluten. For me, the mini pies worked really well because each shell was small enough that it did not fall apart. When making a large apple pie, I found I had to do a bit a patching because of cracks in the dough.</p>
<p>I did find that using buckwheat flour sometimes helped with the pliability issues, but one has to be careful since the strong taste does not suit all types of filling.</p>
<p>Other links re. gluten-free flours and pastry (in no particular order). I took my ideas from several of these. As should be clear from the above, I am still experimenting. Even though I&rsquo;ve been happy with some of the results, I&rsquo;m eager to test other methods so that I can find a comfort zone within the gluten free world. A lot of the recipes linked below look quite involved. The great thing about using a scale is that there is less fussing with small individual measurements. Play away!</p>

<p>If you need a shortcut, I have had some success with Glutino GF crumbs elsewhere: we used them in some fantastic crabcakes, but that&rsquo;s another story.</p>
<p>For the proper flavour in any Christmas pudding, it is important to start early. I did not, so I can say that 2 weeks of maturing time was just about enough. I did top up with brandy every few days to help the process! If you want a nice, rich, flavour, the cooked pudding should mature for at least a month. The great thing about this process is that you can make them several months in advance and they will continue to mature. Just check on them from time to time, add a bit more brandy along the way, and you&rsquo;ll have a warm belly and happy tastebuds come Christmas.</p>
<p>On the day itself, we plopped the pudding in the steamer and let it sit for a couple of hours (really, it only needs heating, so half an hour should do it) and it was fine. When we were ready, we turned out the lights, poured on the brandy, and flambéed the pudding. We had ours with whipped cream this year, though normally we have brandy butter.</p>
<p>For those unaccustomed to a Christmas pudding, it is very rich and you&rsquo;ll want to eat only a small amount at a time. Just a few bites and you should be sated.</p>

How did we do it? First of all, I picked up a new kitchen scale. It&amp;rsquo;s digital and switches easily between metric and US standard units. This makes it easy to fool around with different types of gluten-free flour since the only thing that really matters is that there be double the mass of flour to fat.
Right. What about those pies?</description>

<p>How did we do it? First of all, I picked up a new kitchen scale. It&rsquo;s digital and switches easily between metric and US standard units. This makes it easy to fool around with different types of gluten-free flour since the only thing that really matters is that there be double the mass of flour to fat.</p>
<p>Right. What about those pies?</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Cranberry mince pies. For the filling, I pretty much followed the recipe given here: <a href="http://oaktree-cottage.blogspot.com/2008/12/nigellas-cranberry-mince-pies.html">http://oaktree-cottage.blogspot.com/2008/12/nigellas-cranberry-mince-pies.html</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I also made traditional mince pies (again, GF pastry): <a href="http://britishfood.about.com/od/christmas/r/mincemeat.htm">http://britishfood.about.com/od/christmas/r/mincemeat.htm</a></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I may have added some prunes into the mix and also currents. I did not use any candied fruit and had to sub granny smiths for Bramleys.</p>
<p>We are fortunate to have access to a great farm stand that sells excellent quality locallly-raised meat at reasonable prices. I bought a large block of suet from them. When I need a bit, I just take the block out of the freezer, grate what I need, and put the rest back for later.</p>
<p>For the pastry, I played around a bit. In the last batch, I combined roughly equal parts of:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Rice flour (white and brown)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Garbanzo-fava flour</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>and added in a bit of corn starch. The above three ingredients came to about 150gm. Then I put in a couple of teaspoons of xanthan gum and baking powder.</p>
<p>Now for the fat. I&rsquo;m not sure if it made much difference, but I froze all of my fat (lard and butter).</p>
<p>Total fat used: 75 gm</p>
<p>Sometimes I used only butter, sometimes a combination of lard and butter. The latter was a bit crumblier, as you might imagine.</p>
<p>_ Rather than cut the fat through the flour, I grated it, or at least sliced it into tiny pieces before cutting through the flour._</p>
<p>I did use my fingers for less than a minute to crumble the mixture together, then added the cold water&ndash; about 5-6 tablespoons and mixed everything together with a fork.</p>
<p>One the mixture held together, I separated it into two balls and put it in the fridge.</p>
<p>Half and hour later, I was ready to roll.</p>
<p>One note of warning: gluten-free pastry is not as pliable as regular pastry because of the lack of gluten. For me, the mini pies worked really well because each shell was small enough that it did not fall apart. When making a large apple pie, I found I had to do a bit a patching because of cracks in the dough.</p>
<p>I did find that using buckwheat flour sometimes helped with the pliability issues, but one has to be careful since the strong taste does not suit all types of filling.</p>
<p>Other links re: gluten-free flours and pastry (in no particular order). I took my ideas from several of these. As should be clear from the above, I am still experimenting. Even though I&rsquo;ve been happy with some of the results, I&rsquo;m eager to test other methods so that I can find a comfort zone within the gluten free world. A lot of the recipes linked below look quite involved. The great thing about using a scale is that there is less fussing with small individual measurements. Play away!</p>

$ RVM implode Remove XCode:
$ sudo /Developer/Library/uninstall-devtools –mode=all XCode is removed since in 4.2, at least, all references to gcc are linked to llvm-gcc (Apple&amp;rsquo;s) own fork of gcc. llvm will NOT compile ruby.
(One can always re-install from the AppStore later) download and install GCC-10.7-v2.pkg from https://github.com/kennethreitz/osx-gcc-installer/downloads
This will install just the bare-bones GCC compiler. It can safely be overwritten by XCode if you decide to reinstall it, or simple removed using the same command as that used for removing XCode.</description>

<p>[ccW lines=&quot;-1&quot;]1. You request IPv6 glue for your nameservers through:
_ARIN
__IETF
__RIPE
_The registrar of the domain used by your name servers X
2. IPv6 glue for nameservers resides on which nameservers?
The TLDs' X
The ROOTs
Your own</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>
<p>Which of the following queries proves working IPv6 glue?
dig AAAA ns1.exampledomain.tld @tld.server X
dig -x 2001:db8::1 @tld.server
dig A ns1.exampledomain.tld @tld.server
ping ns1.exampledomain.tld</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Which TLD listed below is authoritative for .com &amp; .net IPv6 Glue?
A.GTLD-SERVERS.net X
a0.org.afilias-nst.info
ipv6.arpa
GDNS1.ULTRADNS.NET</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What is another name sometimes used for A or AAAA nameserver glue records found in the top level domain zone files?
CNAME records
GHOST records
host records X
PTR records</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What is a registrar?
An organization that is able to register domains X
A notary
A glue record
A nameserver</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What is a registry?
An organization responsible for operating the authorative nameservers and database for a top level domain X
A host record
A nameserver
A notary</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Why does getting AAAA records for your nameservers in the corresponding TLD (top level domain) zone matter?
It enables entirely native IPv6 DNS queries and makes it possible for IPv6 only hosts to reach the nameservers for your domain, since they can&rsquo;t use glue that is just an A record. X
It doesn&rsquo;t. It&rsquo;s too hard, so you shouldn&rsquo;t bother.
It registers your domain
It provides reverse DNS for your domain</p>

<li>
<p>IPv6 AAAA records have been added for several of the root nameservers.
False
True X</p>
