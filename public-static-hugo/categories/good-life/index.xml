      <description>Of Apple-Pyes: A poem, by Mr. [Leonard] Welsted.
OF all the delicates which Britons try, To please the palate, or delight the eye; Of all the several kinds of sumptuous fare, There’s none that can with apple-pye compare, For costly flavour, or substantial paste, For outward beauty, or for inward taste.
WHEN first this infant dish in fashion came, Th’ ingredients were but coarse, and rude the frame; As yet, unpolish’d in the modern arts, Our fathers eat brown bread instead of tarts: Pyes were but indigested lumps of dough, ’Till time and just expence improv’d them so.</description>

      <description>Delia Smith&amp;rsquo;s (kinda) &amp;mdash; le pâté grossier It&amp;rsquo;s in foreign because Number One Son with his most excellent French shamed me into realising that I have been resting on my regarde-mon-stylo, pre-O-level French for too long, and that I really should make more of an effort. How hard can it be, really? On the similarities betwixt English and French, did Dumas not say that English was just French badly pronounced?</description>
