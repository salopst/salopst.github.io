      <description>Oh, the sadness. Oh, the heartbreak. Never mind, stiff upper lip and all that, and remembering that I got the thing from the dump (sans disk and RAM) over a 18 months ago, it has not had a bad run.
Aaand just in case I come across a PSU and get her running again, she was:

      <description>Sooo, my TP-Link Archer C8 AC1750 Gigabit router decided to not play nice after a short power outage. Didn&amp;rsquo;t do much anyway except keep a couple of machines in a their own little subnet in which the pi-hole was located.
Replaced it with&amp;hellip; NETGEAR GS108Tv2 8-Port Gigabit managed switch and flatten the network a little. Everything was peachy with that set up, but the pihole was still on 172.16.0.0/24&amp;hellip; reconfigured that with [cc lang=&amp;ldquo;bash&amp;rdquo; inline=&amp;ldquo;true&amp;rdquo;]pihole -r[/cc] and all looked well except for the pi-hole could not ping outside of the LAN.</description>

      <description>Getting pretty annoyed with keeping track of which browser on which machine has which add blockers installed, so it&amp;rsquo;s time for a more holistic approach. Enter, stage left, the Pi-hole. In short it:
With a Rapsberry Pi 3 model b and a 64GB micro SD card, a set-up that is beefier than it needs to be, but who knows what the Pi will be used for in the future&amp;hellip;
#1 Get Raspbian, and format micro SD card&amp;mdash; after much jiggling with the unlock tab on the adapter and delicatelyrepeatedly inserting-half-inserting into 2012 Macbook Pro&amp;rsquo;s gunked-up card reader port&amp;hellip;</description>

      <description>#1 plug laptop into eth0

      <description>Like &amp;gt;90% of folk, I&amp;rsquo;ve typically used whatever POS modem/router/switch/WAP combo that my ISP supplied me with. These all-in-ones are pretty convenient, but there is something just not right about bundling so many features into a single unit&amp;hellip; it basically means that whilst is can do all these things it does not do any one thing particularly well.
Wireless range, for example, is particularly bad (even on the 2.4MHz band). Time for a change.</description>

      <description>It can take a wee while after getting &amp;ldquo;sage&amp;rdquo; to hit 1500. Lots of pretty mundane traceroute6-ing, ping-ing and such, but I stuck through it:

Really I should have scripted something to chron submit the result entries when the command result was obviously valid, but by the time I had found a reliable list of valid ipv6 addrs that were alive and correctly reporting it was too late for me to bother&amp;hellip; and besides I sort of enjoyed the daily catharsis of taking five minutes to submit.</description>

      <description>Going to be changing ipv4 addresses a lot over the next little while, so I&amp;rsquo;ve decided to try a different v4-6 brokering arrangement. he.net&amp;rsquo;s tunnelbroker has been rock solid and I&amp;rsquo;ve been using it on and off since &amp;lsquo;08, but I think it time to try something else.
The ideal would be a self-monitoring client that identifies local ipv4 changes here (kind like a dynDNS client might), and renegotiate an ipv6 endpoint to tunnel through based on that change.</description>
