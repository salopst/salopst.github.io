      <description>Delia Smith&amp;rsquo;s (kinda) &amp;mdash; le pâté grossier It&amp;rsquo;s in foreign because Number One Son with his most excellent French shamed me into realising that I have been resting on my regarde-mon-stylo, pre-O-level French for too long, and that I really should make more of an effort. How hard can it be, really? On the similarities betwixt English and French, did Dumas not say that English was just French badly pronounced?</description>

      <description>My mother seems to have had rather a lot of damsons on her tree this year. This heavy cropping combined with heavy rain over the last few days has lead to some immediate load-reduction on the broken limb. Fsck the impecunious nature of the (lack of?) pruning over recent years.

I think some kind of everything-damson is in order. But let&amp;rsquo;s start with a pie. Now, I cannot bake for toffee so this should be fun&amp;hellip;</description>

      <description>We have been making miso soup for so long that, like many other cooked (rather than baked) dishes, we no longer follow recipes so much as we follow principles. Miso has been a winner in our house with the boys, and is a &amp;lsquo;go to&amp;rsquo; soup. It is a relatively rare day when there is not a pot simmering on the stove. It works as a warming drink around about breakfast time, a soothing drink about bed time, and it works as a decent starter to any meal.</description>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s been a while since we&amp;rsquo;ve baked cookies in this house. In honour of 5 de mayo, we decided to try our hand at some masa-based cookies. The result? Gluten free goodies that went down in the GF and non-GF corners of the house, and that were appealing to the sweet tooth and those who prefer things less sweet.

The recipe I used for guidance was this one.
We tend to reduce the added sugar by about one half, so the resulting recipe was (roughly!</description>

Hmmm. 45 minutes until soccer/football practice. Warm-ish spring evening. We need something filling, something quick, so why not try something I&amp;rsquo;ve never made before: corn dogs. So, with Simply Red&amp;rsquo;s Fairground on loop in the background we begin&amp;hellip;
Slice 4 lamb sausages lengthways, and fry. Remove them before they are fully cooked, and set aside to cool on an absorbent material to soak up the excess fat.</description>

Corn (maize) tortillas have to be the quintessential American bread. American as in &amp;lsquo;from the Americas&amp;rsquo;, not &amp;lsquo;USiAn&amp;rsquo;. Several highly organized civilizations flourished in North, Central and South America, all without wheat which was unknown to them. Maize was their staple, and alongside beans, a grass somewhat resembling rice, and potatoes in the South. With these sources of complex carbohydrates who would want for wheat (or barley)?</description>

      <description>Well it does not get any simpler than this, well maybe the granola is, but it is yet another example of a face-plant. Almost every trip to the supermarket in the UK led to the purchase of several boxes of oatcakes. Why? Why did we not think of making these before? Again the impetus has been going gluten-free since, as you might have guessed, the majority of easily/commercially available oatcakes have wheat flour in them.</description>

      <description>Lest y&amp;rsquo;all think that everything works out in our GF kitchen, I&amp;rsquo;ve decided to add that the following did not. Well, not quite. The bread is darned tasty, and is wonderful toasted with a bit of fresh butter. We are BIG butter fans, especially locally made stuff (not Cabots or Land o&#39; Lakes, or anything &amp;lsquo;stick&amp;rsquo; form, really), the sort of butter that is pretty close to tasting of cheese.</description>

      <description>One can&amp;rsquo;t have Thanksgiving without cornbread. This recipe comes as a surprise: I picked up a bag of almond meal whilst shopping and decided to try it as a straight substitute for flour in cornbread. Normally, I use some combination of tapioca flour, garbanzo flour, masa, or any of the other GF powders I have lying around.
With almond meal in hand, I surfed up a couple of recipes, and used this one for inspiration.</description>

      <description>Please, someone, tell me why I did not make granola earlier: for years, I have shied away from purchasing the stuff at the store because it all seems too “fancy” with artificial fruit flavours, etc., that simply do not appeal. What set me to work was seeing “GF granola” on our shopping lists, and realizing just how expensive it is. Really? For what is basically glorified oats? So, I set to; and behold:</description>

      <description>When we wanted a gluten-free graham cracker crust for our key lime meringue pie, we looked to Gluten-Free Girl because we wanted a recipe that included the making of graham crackers, rather than a trip to the store for ready-made, GF graham crackers. We followed that recipe pretty closely and came up with crackers that looked like this:

I am often imprecise with measurements, but note them as closely as I can.</description>

      <description>We can thank STS-133 for our family&amp;rsquo;s appreciation of key lime pie. While we did see it launch in the end, our first journey to Florida included a trip to the Keys while we waited to hear whether the mission would go ahead. That first trip may end up being the first and last time we sample proper Key Lime Pie, but we&amp;rsquo;ll continue to experiment on our own versions that bring us back to Islamorada.</description>

      <description>Gluten-free beef pasties. (This is one where you’ll have to use your own judgment regarding amounts: we just threw it together, but the addition of lamb stock made the filling especially rich. The point of this post? You can be gluten-free and still feed that craving for a pasty.)

      <description>The first time I tried to make gluten-free dumplings, they worked out beautifully. Indeed, the existence of this blog is largely down to our desire to record those things that go well. For the record: I have not yet replicated those wonderful dumplings, but am working on it.

      <description>Shortly after going gluten-free, we tried Bob&amp;rsquo;s Red Mill gluten-free pizza crust. Having lived in New Haven for many years, we like pizza. Bob&amp;rsquo;s didn&amp;rsquo;t measure up, so that was it&amp;hellip;until now. This might not be apizza, but as long as we&amp;rsquo;re gluten-free we may have to settle for a bit less.

Having found a hit with buckwheat pancakes, I decided to try a buckwheat pizza crust. The recipe I adopted was basically the one described here, but without the garlic powder.</description>

      <description>We are big lovers of cornmeal pancakes in our family, but the boys were hankering for something closer to traditional wheat ones, so we figured it was time to throw together a batch of buckwheat pancakes.

Yield: 7 large pancakes
The ingredients:
  1 cup (120 g) buckwheat flour
  ½ cup (20 g) masa harina
  ¼ tsp. baking soda
  2/3 tsp. baking powder</description>

I surfed up a recipe for gluten-free naan bread, and this is what I found: http://www.food.com/recipe/gluten-free-naan-roti-indian-flat-bread-version-1-189334
I spent less than 30 minutes from start to finish, and in the end we had 2 large and 3 smaller naan breads.The final recipe looked like this:</description>

      <description>Even though this is our first gluten-free Christmas, we didn&amp;rsquo;t want to miss out on the pudding. So, we made our own. I was apprehensive, but need not have been.

The basic recipe I followed was this one. Note that you have to scroll down the page quite a ways to actually reach the recipe.
I also had this one on hand and my final result combined aspects of both and may have included some improvisation re: dried fruits.</description>

      <description>How did we do it? First of all, I picked up a new kitchen scale. It&amp;rsquo;s digital and switches easily between metric and US standard units. This makes it easy to fool around with different types of gluten-free flour since the only thing that really matters is that there be double the mass of flour to fat.
Right. What about those pies?
