                <p>[TYPES]</p>
<p><strong>Virginias</strong> usually represent the highest percentage in a blend. Although there&rsquo;s a wide range of Virginias to choose from, including bright VA&rsquo;s, matured VA&rsquo;s, and stoved VA&rsquo;s, in general the lighter the color the tangier the taste, with the darker VA&rsquo;s lending a deep, rich note to the blend. Unprocessed VA&rsquo;s tend to produce tongue bite, and stoved VA&rsquo;s tend to bite much less.</p>
<p><strong>Burley</strong>, like VA, is a good base tobacco. It has no sugar of its own, but is relatively bite-free. It should never come to the forefront, but be used sparingly. The &ldquo;Burley Curse&rdquo; refers to the habit this tobacco has of overpowering a blend. Burley has a distinct nutty taste, but because of its somewhat bland character, is often flavored.</p>
<p><strong>Cavendish</strong> generally refers to a blend of various tobaccos that have been sweetened, stoved, and pressed. Unflavored black cavendish, for instance, is made from Kentucky Green River burley, which is sugared, steamed and toasted, yielding a distinct caramel flavor. In a blend, cavendish can be used sparingly, to add body or flavor, or become the base, yielding a sweet tobacco. It goes particularly well with Latakia.</p>
<p><strong>Perique</strong> is a &ldquo;spice tobacco&rdquo;, with a distinct peppery flavor. Produced mostly in Louisiana from various base tobaccos, and cured in its own juices, this not only adds spice to a VA blend, but also mitigates a lot of the bite that comes with it. When not part of a straight VA/Perique blend, it should only be added to the point that it becomes noticeable. In a regular VA/Perique blend, it can represent a higher percentage, though 10% is often enough.</p>
<p><strong>Latakia</strong> is Turkish tobacco flavored with smoke. Syrian Latakia is strong and bright, while Cyprian Latakia has a deeper, mellower flavor. This is another spice tobacco, and needs a base tobacco to keep it in check. Fifty percent Latakia would be considered a &ldquo;heavy Latakia blend&rdquo;. It&rsquo;s generally wise to use less Syrian than Cyprian.</p>
<p><strong>Oriental</strong> is spice tobacco from the Eastern Mediterranean (countries such as Turkey or Greece). Somewhat akin to Latakia, this is spicy and sweet. Most oriental tobacco is a blend. Even a label that refers to it as one distinct type (such as basma), is usually referring to its main component. Turkish is often used to fill out the general impression of a Latakia. Again, on its own, 50% would be considered a &ldquo;heavy Oriental&rdquo;.</p>
<p><strong>Maryland</strong> and Carolina can be thought of as &ldquo;filler&rdquo; tobaccos, used mainly to flesh out the taste of a VA or Burley base. Not terribly distinctive, these can be used to mitigate tongue bite.</p>

<p>[CUTS]</p>
<p><strong>Cavendish</strong>- A very important process in today&rsquo;s tobaccos. Cavendishes, in older blends, generally referred to tobaccos which had been treated with flavorings or even sugar water, sometimes steamed (mainly in Black Cavendish), pressed, cut, and rubbed-out. These were the original aromatics. Through the years the term has become watered-down, and is commonly used to refer to any flavored tobacco blend.</p>
<p><strong>Flake</strong>- Tobaccos, normally whole-leaf, that have been pressed, and usually sliced, are called Flakes. The pressure aids in the maturing process, and brings out a richer flavor. The most common Flakes are based upon Virginias, and Virginia blends.</p>
<p><strong>Krumble Kake</strong>- Cut tobaccos which have been pressed are sometimes referred to as Krumble Kake. It is so named since a chunk of it can be easily rubbed-out into small pieces.</p>
<p><strong>Cubed</strong>- Pressed tobacco which has been cut into fine or coarse cube-shaped pieces is called Cubed, with the most common type being Cubed Burley. The thick, chunky pieces burn slowly, so Cubed tobaccos are normally quite cool.</p>
<p><strong>Rough Cut</strong>- Tobaccos cut into larger flat pieces are called Rough Cut. This cut burns slowly, and can be used to keep hotter tobaccos from burning too fast.</p>
<p><strong>Broad Cut- Wide, ribbon</strong> -cuts, which burn at an average pace, and pack well, are often called Broad Cut.</p>
<p><strong>Ribbon</strong>- Narrower than Broad Cut, it burns more readily (a good cut for tobaccos that don&rsquo;t burn easily), and packs well.</p>
<p><strong>Shag</strong>- A very stringy ribbon cut, Shag can easily pack too tightly, and burns easily. At one time Shag was considered an inferior cut.</p>
<p><strong>Twist, Roll Cut and Rope</strong>- All are rolled tobaccos, twisted (at least to some degree) to create pressure to help mature the tobacco. Sometimes the tobaccos are cased for flavor. They are normally cut into &ldquo;coins&rdquo;, and can be packed whole, or rubbed-out.</p>
<p>And two terms that are important to know-</p>
<p><strong>Casing</strong>- Referred to earlier, Casings are flavorings, sometimes using an alcohol base, that are added early in the processing. Casings are primarily used to add flavor to a blend.</p>
<p><strong>Top Dressing</strong>- Top Dressings are added toward the end of processing, and their main purpose is to enhance room note, or aroma.</p>
